<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>On a bright autumn day, as long ago as the year 943, there was
a great bustle in the Castle of Bayeux in Normandy.</p>
<p>The hall was large and low, the roof arched, and supported on
thick short columns, almost like the crypt of a Cathedral; the
walls were thick, and the windows, which had no glass, were very
small, set in such a depth of wall that there was a wide deep
window seat, upon which the rain might beat, without reaching the
interior of the room.&nbsp; And even if it had come in, there was
nothing for it to hurt, for the walls were of rough stone, and
the floor of tiles.&nbsp; There was a fire at each end of this
great dark apartment, but there were no chimneys over the ample
hearths, and the smoke curled about in thick white folds in the
vaulted roof, adding to the wreaths of soot, which made the hall
look still darker.</p>
<p>The fire at the lower end was by far the largest and
hottest.&nbsp; Great black cauldrons hung over it, and servants,
both men and women, with red faces, bare and grimed arms, and
long iron hooks, or pots and pans, were busied around it.&nbsp;
At the other end, which was raised about three steps above the
floor of the hall, other servants were engaged.&nbsp; Two young
maidens were strewing fresh rushes on the floor; some men were
setting up a long table of rough boards, supported on trestles,
and then ranging upon it silver cups, drinking horns, and wooden
trenchers.</p>
<p>Benches were placed to receive most of the guests, but in the
middle, at the place of honour, was a high chair with very thick
crossing legs, and the arms curiously carved with lions&rsquo;
faces and claws; a clumsy wooden footstool was set in front, and
the silver drinking-cup on the table was of far more beautiful
workmanship than the others, richly chased with vine leaves and
grapes, and figures of little boys with goats&rsquo; legs.&nbsp;
If that cup could have told its story, it would have been a
strange one, for it had been made long since, in the old Roman
times, and been carried off from Italy by some Northman
pirate.</p>
<p>From one of these scenes of activity to the other, there moved
a stately old lady: her long thick light hair, hardly touched
with grey, was bound round her head, under a tall white cap, with
a band passing under her chin: she wore a long sweeping dark
robe, with wide hanging sleeves, and thick gold ear-rings and
necklace, which had possibly come from the same quarter as the
cup.&nbsp; She directed the servants, inspected both the cookery
and arrangements of the table, held council with an old steward,
now and then looked rather anxiously from the window, as if
expecting some one, and began to say something about fears that
these loitering youths would not bring home the venison in time
for Duke William&rsquo;s supper.</p>
<p>Presently, she looked up rejoiced, for a few notes of a
bugle-horn were sounded; there was a clattering of feet, and in a
few moments there bounded into the hall, a boy of about eight
years old, his cheeks and large blue eyes bright with air and
exercise, and his long light-brown hair streaming behind him, as
he ran forward flourishing a bow in his hand, and crying out,
&ldquo;I hit him, I hit him!&nbsp; Dame Astrida, do you
hear?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a stag of ten branches, and I hit him in
the neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! my Lord Richard! you killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I only struck him.&nbsp; It was Osmond&rsquo;s
shaft that took him in the eye, and&mdash;Look you, Fru Astrida,
he came thus through the wood, and I stood here, it might be,
under the great elm with my bow thus&rdquo;&mdash;And Richard was
beginning to act over again the whole scene of the deer-hunt, but
Fru, that is to say, Lady Astrida, was too busy to listen, and
broke in with, &ldquo;Have they brought home the
haunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter is bringing it.&nbsp; I had a long
arrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p4b.jpg">
<img alt="Richard with Dame Estrida" src="images/p4s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A stout forester was at this instant seen bringing in the
venison, and Dame Astrida hastened to meet it, and gave
directions, little Richard following her all the way, and talking
as eagerly as if she was attending to him, showing how he shot,
how Osmond shot, how the deer bounded, and how it fell, and then
counting the branches of its antlers, always ending with,
&ldquo;This is something to tell my father.&nbsp; Do you think he
will come soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime two men entered the hall, one about fifty, the
other, one or two-and-twenty, both in hunting dresses of plain
leather, crossed by broad embroidered belts, supporting a knife,
and a bugle-horn.&nbsp; The elder was broad-shouldered,
sun-burnt, ruddy, and rather stern-looking; the younger, who was
also the taller, was slightly made, and very active, with a
bright keen grey eye, and merry smile.&nbsp; These were Dame
Astrida&rsquo;s son, Sir Eric de Centeville, and her grandson,
Osmond; and to their care Duke William of Normandy had committed
his only child, Richard, to be fostered, or brought up. <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>It was always the custom among the Northmen, that young
princes should thus be put under the care of some trusty vassal,
instead of being brought up at home, and one reason why the
Centevilles had been chosen by Duke William was, that both Sir
Eric and his mother spoke only the old Norwegian tongue, which he
wished young Richard to understand well, whereas, in other parts
of the Duchy, the Normans had forgotten their own tongue, and had
taken up what was then called the
Langu&eacute;d&rsquo;ou&igrave;, a language between German and
Latin, which was the beginning of French.</p>
<p>On this day, Duke William himself was expected at Bayeux, to
pay a visit to his son before setting out on a journey to settle
the disputes between the Counts of Flanders and Montreuil, and
this was the reason of Fru Astrida&rsquo;s great
preparations.&nbsp; No sooner had she seen the haunch placed upon
a spit, which a little boy was to turn before the fire, than she
turned to dress something else, namely, the young Prince Richard
himself, whom she led off to one of the upper rooms, and there he
had full time to talk, while she, great lady though she was,
herself combed smooth his long flowing curls, and fastened his
short scarlet cloth tunic, which just reached to his knee,
leaving his neck, arms, and legs bare.&nbsp; He begged hard to be
allowed to wear a short, beautifully ornamented dagger at his
belt, but this Fru Astrida would not allow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have enough to do with steel and dagger before
your life is at an end,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;without seeking
to begin over soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I shall,&rdquo; answered Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will be called Richard of the Sharp Axe, or the Bold
Spirit, I promise you, Fru Astrida.&nbsp; We are as brave in
these days as the Sigurds and Ragnars you sing of!&nbsp; I only
wish there were serpents and dragons to slay here in
Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear but you will find even too many of
them,&rdquo; said Dame Astrida; &ldquo;there be dragons of wrong
here and everywhere, quite as venomous as any in my
Sagas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear them not,&rdquo; said Richard, but half
understanding her, &ldquo;if you would only let me have the
dagger!&nbsp; But, hark! hark!&rdquo; he darted to the
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;They come, they come!&nbsp; There is the
banner of Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away ran the happy child, and never rested till he stood at
the bottom of the long, steep, stone stair, leading to the
embattled porch.&nbsp; Thither came the Baron de Centeville, and
his son, to receive their Prince.&nbsp; Richard looked up at
Osmond, saying, &ldquo;Let me hold his stirrup,&rdquo; and then
sprang up and shouted for joy, as under the arched gateway there
came a tall black horse, bearing the stately form of the Duke of
Normandy.&nbsp; His purple robe was fastened round him by a rich
belt, sustaining the mighty weapon, from which he was called
&ldquo;William of the long Sword,&rdquo; his legs and feet were
cased in linked steel chain-work, his gilded spurs were on his
heels, and his short brown hair was covered by his ducal cap of
purple, turned up with fur, and a feather fastened in by a
jewelled clasp.&nbsp; His brow was grave and thoughtful, and
there was something both of dignity and sorrow in his face, at
the first moment of looking at it, recalling the recollection
that he had early lost his young wife, the Duchess Emma, and that
he was beset by many cares and toils; but the next glance
generally conveyed encouragement, so full of mildness were his
eyes, and so kind the expression of his lips.</p>
<p>And now, how bright a smile beamed upon the little Richard,
who, for the first time, paid him the duty of a pupil in
chivalry, by holding the stirrup while he sprung from his
horse.&nbsp; Next, Richard knelt to receive his blessing, which
was always the custom when children met their parents.&nbsp; The
Duke laid his hand on his head, saying, &ldquo;God of His mercy
bless thee, my son,&rdquo; and lifting him in his arms, held him
to his breast, and let him cling to his neck and kiss him again
and again, before setting him down, while Sir Eric came forward,
bent his knee, kissed the hand of his Prince, and welcomed him to
his Castle.</p>
<p>It would take too long to tell all the friendly and courteous
words that were spoken, the greeting of the Duke and the noble
old Lady Astrida, and the reception of the Barons who had come in
the train of their Lord.&nbsp; Richard was bidden to greet them,
but, though he held out his hand as desired, he shrank a little
to his father&rsquo;s side, gazing at them in dread and
shyness.</p>
<p>There was Count Bernard, of Harcourt, called the
&ldquo;Dane,&rdquo; <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> with his shaggy red hair and beard, to
which a touch of grey had given a strange unnatural tint, his
eyes looking fierce and wild under his thick eyebrows, one of
them mis-shapen in consequence of a sword cut, which had left a
broad red and purple scar across both cheek and forehead.&nbsp;
There, too, came tall Baron Rainulf, of Ferri&egrave;res, cased
in a linked steel hauberk, that rang as he walked, and the
men-at-arms, with helmets and shields, looking as if Sir
Eric&rsquo;s armour that hung in the hail had come to life and
was walking about.</p>
<p>They sat down to Fru Astrida&rsquo;s banquet, the old Lady at
the Duke&rsquo;s right hand, and the Count of Harcourt on his
left; Osmond carved for the Duke, and Richard handed his cup and
trencher.&nbsp; All through the meal, the Duke and his Lords
talked earnestly of the expedition on which they were bound to
meet Count Arnulf of Flanders, on a little islet in the river
Somme, there to come to some agreement, by which Arnulf might
make restitution to Count Herluin of Montreuil, for certain
wrongs which he had done him.</p>
<p>Some said that this would be the fittest time for requiring
Arnulf to yield up some towns on his borders, to which Normandy
had long laid claim, but the Duke shook his head, saying that he
must seek no selfish advantage, when called to judge between
others.</p>
<p>Richard was rather tired of their grave talk, and thought the
supper very long; but at last it was over, the Grace was said,
the boards which had served for tables were removed, and as it
was still light, some of the guests went to see how their steeds
had been bestowed, others to look at Sir Eric&rsquo;s horses and
hounds, and others collected together in groups.</p>
<p>The Duke had time to attend to his little boy, and Richard sat
upon his knee and talked, told about all his pleasures, how his
arrow had hit the deer to-day, how Sir Eric let him ride out to
the chase on his little pony, how Osmond would take him to bathe
in the cool bright river, and how he had watched the
raven&rsquo;s nest in the top of the old tower.</p>
<p>Duke William listened, and smiled, and seemed as well pleased
to hear as the boy was to tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, Richard,&rdquo;
said he at last, &ldquo;have you nought to tell me of Father
Lucas, and his great book?&nbsp; What, not a word?&nbsp; Look up,
Richard, and tell me how it goes with the learning.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; said Richard, in a low voice,
playing with the clasp of his father&rsquo;s belt, and looking
down, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like those crabbed letters on the old
yellow parchment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you try to learn them, I hope!&rdquo; said the
Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, I do, but they are very hard, and the
words are so long, and Father Lucas will always come when the sun
is so bright, and the wood so green, that I know not how to bear
to be kept poring over those black hooks and strokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little fellow,&rdquo; said Duke William, smiling
and Richard, rather encouraged, went on more boldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You do not know this reading, noble father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my sorrow, no,&rdquo; said the Duke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sir Eric cannot read, nor Osmond, nor any one, and
why must I read, and cramp my fingers with writing, just as if I
was a clerk, instead of a young Duke?&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard looked
up in his father&rsquo;s face, and then hung his head, as if
half-ashamed of questioning his will, but the Duke answered him
without displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard, no doubt, my boy, to you now, but it will
be the better for you in the end.&nbsp; I would give much to be
able myself to read those holy books which I must now only hear
read to me by a clerk, but since I have had the wish, I have had
no time to learn as you have now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Knights and Nobles never learn,&rdquo; said
Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think it a reason they never should?&nbsp;
But you are wrong, my boy, for the Kings of France and England,
the Counts of Anjou, of Provence, and Paris, yes, even King Hako
of Norway, <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a> can all read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Richard, when the treaty was drawn up for
restoring this King Louis to his throne, I was ashamed to find
myself one of the few crown vassals who could not write his name
thereto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But none is so wise or so good as you, father,&rdquo;
said Richard, proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Eric often says
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Eric loves his Duke too well to see his
faults,&rdquo; said Duke William; &ldquo;but far better and wiser
might I have been, had I been taught by such masters as you may
be.&nbsp; And hark, Richard, not only can all Princes here read,
but in England, King Ethelstane would have every Noble taught;
they study in his own palace, with his brothers, and read the
good words that King Alfred the truth-teller put into their own
tongue for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate the English,&rdquo; said Richard, raising his
head and looking very fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate them? and wherefore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they traitorously killed the brave Sea King
Ragnar!&nbsp; Fru Astrida sings his death-song, which he chanted
when the vipers were gnawing him to death, and he gloried to
think how his sons would bring the ravens to feast upon the
Saxon.&nbsp; Oh! had I been his son, how I would have carried on
the feud!&nbsp; How I would have laughed when I cut down the
false traitors, and burnt their palaces!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Richard&rsquo;s eye kindled, and his words, as he spoke the old
Norse language, flowed into the sort of wild verse in which the
Sagas or legendary songs were composed, and which, perhaps, he
was unconsciously repeating.</p>
<p>Duke William looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fru Astrida must sing you no more such Sagas,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;if they fill your mind with these revengeful
thoughts, fit only for the worshippers of Odin and Thor.&nbsp;
Neither Ragnar nor his sons knew better than to rejoice in this
deadly vengeance, but we, who are Christians, know that it is for
us to forgive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English had slain their father!&rdquo; said
Richard, looking up with wondering dissatisfied eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Richard, and I speak not against them, for they
were even as we should have been, had not King Harold the
fair-haired driven your grandfather from Denmark.&nbsp; They had
not been taught the truth, but to us it has been said,
&lsquo;Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.&rsquo;&nbsp; Listen to
me, my son, Christian as is this nation of ours, this duty of
forgiveness is too often neglected, but let it not be so with
you.&nbsp; Bear in mind, whenever you see the Cross <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> marked on our banner, or carved in stone
on the Churches, that it speaks of forgiveness to us; but of that
pardon we shall never taste if we forgive not our enemies.&nbsp;
Do you mark me, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard hesitated a little, and then said, &ldquo;Yes, father,
but I could never have pardoned, had I been one of Ragnar&rsquo;s
sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be that you will be in their case,
Richard,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;and should I fall, as it
may well be I shall, in some of the contests that tear to pieces
this unhappy Kingdom of France, then, remember what I say
now.&nbsp; I charge you, on your duty to God and to your father,
that you keep up no feud, no hatred, but rather that you should
deem me best revenged, when you have with heart and hand, given
the fullest proof of forgiveness to your enemy.&nbsp; Give me
your word that you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said Richard, with rather a subdued
tone, and resting his head on his father&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp;
There was a silence for a little space, during which he began to
revive into playfulness, to stroke the Duke&rsquo;s short curled
beard, and play with his embroidered collar.</p>
<p>In so doing, his fingers caught hold of a silver chain, and
pulling it out with a jerk, he saw a silver key attached to
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, what is that?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What does that key unlock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My greatest treasure,&rdquo; replied Duke William, as
he replaced the chain and key within his robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your greatest treasure, father!&nbsp; Is that your
coronet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will know one day,&rdquo; said his father, putting
the little hand down from its too busy investigations; and some
of the Barons at that moment returning into the hall, he had no
more leisure to bestow on his little son.</p>
<p>The next day, after morning service in the Chapel, and
breakfast in the hall, the Duke again set forward on his journey,
giving Richard hopes he might return in a fortnight&rsquo;s time,
and obtaining from him a promise that he would be very attentive
to Father Lucas, and very obedient to Sir Eric de Centeville.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>One evening Fru Astrida sat in her tall chair in the chimney
corner, her distaff, with its load of flax in her hand, while she
twisted and drew out the thread, and her spindle danced on the
floor.&nbsp; Opposite to her sat, sleeping in his chair, Sir Eric
de Centeville; Osmond was on a low bench within the chimney
corner, trimming and shaping with his knife some feathers of the
wild goose, which were to fly in a different fashion from their
former one, and serve, not to wing the flight of a harmless
goose, but of a sharp arrow.</p>
<p>The men of the household sat ranged on benches on one side of
the hall, the women on the other; a great red fire, together with
an immense flickering lamp which hung from the ceiling, supplied
the light; the windows were closed with wooden shutters, and the
whole apartment had a cheerful appearance.&nbsp; Two or three
large hounds were reposing in front of the hearth, and among them
sat little Richard of Normandy, now smoothing down their broad
silken ears; now tickling the large cushions of their feet with
the end of one of Osmond&rsquo;s feathers; now fairly pulling
open the eyes of one of the good-natured sleepy creatures, which
only stretched its legs, and remonstrated with a sort of low
groan, rather than a growl.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s eyes were, all
the time, intently fixed on Dame Astrida, as if he would not lose
one word of the story she was telling him; how Earl Rollo, his
grandfather, had sailed into the mouth of the Seine, and how
Archbishop Franco, of Rouen, had come to meet him and brought him
the keys of the town, and how not one Neustrian of Rouen had met
with harm from the brave Northmen.&nbsp; Then she told him of his
grandfather&rsquo;s baptism, and how during the seven days that
he wore his white baptismal robes, he had made large gifts to all
the chief churches in his dukedom of Normandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but tell of the paying homage!&rdquo; said Richard;
&ldquo;and how Sigurd Bloodaxe threw down simple King
Charles!&nbsp; Ah! how would I have laughed to see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, Lord Richard,&rdquo; said the old lady,
&ldquo;I love not that tale.&nbsp; That was ere the Norman learnt
courtesy, and rudeness ought rather to be forgotten than
remembered, save for the sake of amending it.&nbsp; No, I will
rather tell you of our coming to Centeville, and how dreary I
thought these smooth meads, and broad soft gliding streams,
compared with mine own father&rsquo;s fiord in Norway, shut in
with the tall black rocks, and dark pines above them, and far
away the snowy mountains rising into the sky.&nbsp; Ah! how blue
the waters were in the long summer days when I sat in my
father&rsquo;s boat in the little fiord, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dame Astrida was interrupted.&nbsp; A bugle note rang out at
the castle gate; the dogs started to their feet, and uttered a
sudden deafening bark; Osmond sprung up, exclaiming,
&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; and trying to silence the hounds; and Richard
running to Sir Eric, cried, &ldquo;Wake, wake, Sir Eric, my
father is come!&nbsp; Oh, haste to open the gate, and admit
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, dogs!&rdquo; said Sir Eric, slowly rising, as
the blast of the horn was repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, Osmond, with
the porter, and see whether he who comes at such an hour be
friend or foe.&nbsp; Stay you here, my Lord,&rdquo; he added, as
Richard was running after Osmond; and the little boy obeyed, and
stood still, though quivering all over with impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tidings from the Duke, I should guess,&rdquo; said Fru
Astrida.&nbsp; &ldquo;It can scarce be himself at such an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it must be, dear Fru Astrida!&rdquo; said
Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said he would come again.&nbsp; Hark,
there are horses&rsquo; feet in the court!&nbsp; I am sure that
is his black charger&rsquo;s tread!&nbsp; And I shall not be
there to hold his stirrup!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Sir Eric, let me
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Eric, always a man of few words, only shook his head, and
at that moment steps were heard on the stone stairs.&nbsp; Again
Richard was about to spring forward, when Osmond returned, his
face showing, at a glance, that something was amiss; but all that
he said was, &ldquo;Count Bernard of Harcourt, and Sir Rainulf de
Ferri&egrave;res,&rdquo; and he stood aside to let them pass.</p>
<p>Richard stood still in the midst of the hall,
disappointed.&nbsp; Without greeting to Sir Eric, or to any
within the hall, the Count of Harcourt came forward to Richard,
bent his knee before him, took his hand, and said with a broken
voice and heaving breast, &ldquo;Richard, Duke of Normandy, I am
thy liegeman and true vassal;&rdquo; then rising from his knees
while Rainulf de Ferri&egrave;res went through the same form, the
old man covered his face with his hands and wept aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it even so?&rdquo; said the Baron de Centeville; and
being answered by a mournful look and sigh from Ferri&egrave;res,
he too bent before the boy, and repeated the words, &ldquo;I am
thy liegeman and true vassal, and swear fealty to thee for my
castle and barony of Centeville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no!&rdquo; cried Richard, drawing back his hand
in a sort of agony, feeling as if he was in a frightful dream
from which he could not awake.&nbsp; &ldquo;What means it?&nbsp;
Oh!&nbsp; Fru Astrida, tell me what means it?&nbsp; Where is my
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p22b.jpg">
<img alt="The oath of the vassals" src="images/p22s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, my child!&rdquo; said the old lady, putting her
arm round him, and drawing him close to her, whilst her tears
flowed fast, and Richard stood, reassured by her embrace,
listening with eyes open wide, and deep oppressed breathing, to
what was passing between the four nobles, who spoke earnestly
among themselves, without much heed of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke dead!&rdquo; repeated Sir Eric de Centeville,
like one stunned and stupefied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; said Rainulf, slowly and sadly, and the
silence was only broken by the long-drawn sobs of old Count
Bernard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how? when? where?&rdquo; broke forth Sir Eric,
presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was no note of battle when you went
forth.&nbsp; Oh, why was not I at his side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fell not in battle,&rdquo; gloomily replied Sir
Rainulf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! could sickness cut him down so quickly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not sickness,&rdquo; answered
Ferri&egrave;res.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was treachery.&nbsp; He fell in
the Isle of Pecquigny, by the hand of the false
Fleming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lives the traitor yet?&rdquo; cried the Baron de
Centeville, grasping his good sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives and rejoices in his crime,&rdquo; said
Ferri&egrave;res, &ldquo;safe in his own merchant
towns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarce credit you, my Lords!&rdquo; said Sir
Eric.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Duke slain, and his enemy safe, and you
here to tell the tale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would I were stark and stiff by my Lord&rsquo;s
side!&rdquo; said Count Bernard, &ldquo;but for the sake of
Normandy, and of that poor child, who is like to need all that
ever were friends to his house.&nbsp; I would that mine eyes had
been blinded for ever, ere they had seen that sight!&nbsp; And
not a sword lifted in his defence!&nbsp; Tell you how it passed,
Rainulf!&nbsp; My tongue will not speak it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw himself on a bench and covered his face with his
mantle, while Rainulf de Ferri&egrave;res proceeded: &ldquo;You
know how in an evil hour our good Duke appointed to meet this
caitiff, Count of Flanders, in the Isle of Pecquigny, the Duke
and Count each bringing twelve men with them, all unarmed.&nbsp;
Duke Alan of Brittany was one on our side, Count Bernard here
another, old Count Bothon and myself; we bore no
weapon&mdash;would that we had&mdash;but not so the false
Flemings.&nbsp; Ah me!&nbsp; I shall never forget Duke
William&rsquo;s lordly presence when he stepped ashore, and
doffed his bonnet to the knave Arnulf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interposed Bernard.&nbsp; &ldquo;And marked
you not the words of the traitor, as they met?&nbsp; &lsquo;My
Lord,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;you are my shield and
defence.&rsquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Would that I could cleave his
treason-hatching skull with my battle-axe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; continued Rainulf, &ldquo;they conferred
together, and as words cost nothing to Arnulf, he not only
promised all restitution to the paltry Montreuil, but even was
for offering to pay homage to our Duke for Flanders itself; but
this our William refused, saying it were foul wrong to both King
Louis of France, and Kaiser Otho of Germany, to take from them
their vassal.&nbsp; They took leave of each other in all
courtesy, and we embarked again.&nbsp; It was Duke
William&rsquo;s pleasure to go alone in a small boat, while we
twelve were together in another.&nbsp; Just as we had nearly
reached our own bank, there was a shout from the Flemings that
their Count had somewhat further to say to the Duke, and
forbidding us to follow him, the Duke turned his boat and went
back again.&nbsp; No sooner had he set foot on the isle,&rdquo;
proceeded the Norman, clenching his hands, and speaking between
his teeth, &ldquo;than we saw one Fleming strike him on the head
with an oar; he fell senseless, the rest threw themselves upon
him, and the next moment held up their bloody daggers in scorn at
us!&nbsp; You may well think how we shouted and yelled at them,
and plied our oars like men distracted, but all in vain, they
were already in their boats, and ere we could even reach the
isle, they were on the other side of the river, mounted their
horses, fled with coward speed, and were out of reach of a
Norman&rsquo;s vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they shall not be so long!&rdquo; cried Richard,
starting forward; for to his childish fancy this dreadful history
was more like one of Dame Astrida&rsquo;s legends than a reality,
and at the moment his thought was only of the blackness of the
treason.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, that I were a man to chastise
them!&nbsp; One day they shall feel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short, for he remembered how his father had
forbidden his denunciations of vengeance, but his words were
eagerly caught up by the Barons, who, as Duke William had said,
were far from possessing any temper of forgiveness, thought
revenge a duty, and were only glad to see a warlike spirit in
their new Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! say you so, my young Lord?&rdquo; exclaimed old
Count Bernard, rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, and I see a sparkle in
your eye that tells me you will one day avenge him
nobly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard drew up his head, and his heart throbbed high as Sir
Eric made answer, &ldquo;Ay, truly, that will he!&nbsp; You might
search Normandy through, yea, and Norway likewise, ere you would
find a temper more bold and free.&nbsp; Trust my word, Count
Bernard, our young Duke will be famed as widely as ever were his
forefathers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it well!&rdquo; said Bernard.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
hath the port of his grandfather, Duke Rollo, and much, too, of
his noble father!&nbsp; How say you, Lord Richard, will you be a
valiant leader of the Norman race against our foes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will!&rdquo; said Richard, carried away by the
applause excited by those few words of his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
ride at your head this very night if you will but go to chastise
the false Flemings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall ride with us to-morrow, my Lord,&rdquo;
answered Bernard, &ldquo;but it must be to Rouen, there to be
invested with your ducal sword and mantle, and to receive the
homage of your vassals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard drooped his head without replying, for this seemed to
bring to him the perception that his father was really gone, and
that he should never see him again.&nbsp; He thought of all his
projects for the day of his return, how he had almost counted the
hours, and had looked forward to telling him that Father Lucas
was well pleased with him!&nbsp; And now he should never nestle
into his breast again, never hear his voice, never see those kind
eyes beam upon him.&nbsp; Large tears gathered in his eyes, and
ashamed that they should be seen, he sat down on a footstool at
Fru Astrida&rsquo;s feet, leant his forehead on his hands, and
thought over all that his father had done and said the last time
they were together.&nbsp; He fancied the return that had been
promised, going over the meeting and the greeting, till he had
almost persuaded himself that this dreadful story was but a
dream.&nbsp; But when he looked up, there were the Barons, with
their grave mournful faces, speaking of the corpse, which Duke
Alan of Brittany was escorting to Rouen, there to be buried
beside the old Duke Rollo, and the Duchess Emma, Richard&rsquo;s
mother.&nbsp; Then he lost himself in wonder how that stiff
bleeding body could be the same as the father whose arm was so
lately around him, and whether his father&rsquo;s spirit knew how
he was thinking of him; and in these dreamy thoughts, the young
orphan Duke of Normandy, forgotten by his vassals in their grave
councils, fell asleep, and scarce wakened enough to attend to his
prayers, when Fru Astrida at length remembered him, and led him
away to bed.</p>
<p>When Richard awoke the next morning, he could hardly believe
that all that had passed in the evening was true, but soon he
found that it was but too real, and all was prepared for him to
go to Rouen with the vassals; indeed, it was for no other purpose
than to fetch him that the Count of Harcourt had come to
Bayeux.&nbsp; Fru Astrida was quite unhappy that &ldquo;the
child,&rdquo; as she called him, should go alone with the
warriors; but Sir Eric laughed at her, and said that it would
never do for the Duke of Normandy to bring his nurse with him in
his first entry into Rouen, and she must be content to follow at
some space behind under the escort of Walter the huntsman.</p>
<p>So she took leave of Richard, charging both Sir Eric and
Osmond to have the utmost care of him, and shedding tears as if
the parting was to be for a much longer space; then he bade
farewell to the servants of the castle, received the blessing of
Father Lucas, and mounting his pony, rode off between Sir Eric
and Count Bernard.&nbsp; Richard was but a little boy, and he did
not think so much of his loss, as he rode along in the free
morning air, feeling himself a Prince at the head of his vassals,
his banner displayed before him, and the people coming out
wherever he passed to gaze on him, and call for blessings on his
name.&nbsp; Rainulf de Ferri&egrave;res carried a large heavy
purse filled with silver and gold, and whenever they came to
these gazing crowds, Richard was well pleased to thrust his hands
deep into it, and scatter handfuls of coins among the gazers,
especially where he saw little children.</p>
<p>They stopped to dine and rest in the middle of the day, at the
castle of a Baron, who, as soon as the meal was over, mounted his
horse, and joined them in their ride to Rouen.&nbsp; So far it
had not been very different from Richard&rsquo;s last journey,
when he went to keep Christmas there with his father; but now
they were beginning to come nearer the town, he knew the broad
river Seine again, and saw the square tower of the Cathedral, and
he remembered how at that very place his father had met him, and
how he had ridden by his side into the town, and had been led by
his hand up to the hall.</p>
<p>His heart was very heavy, as he recollected there was no one
now to meet and welcome him; scarcely any one to whom he could
even tell his thoughts, for those tall grave Barons had nothing
to say to such a little boy, and the very respect and formality
with which they treated him, made him shrink from them still
more, especially from the grim-faced Bernard; and Osmond, his own
friend and playfellow, was obliged to ride far behind, as
inferior in rank.</p>
<p>They entered the town just as it was growing dark.&nbsp; Count
Bernard looked back and arrayed the procession; Eric de
Centeville bade Richard sit upright and not look weary, and then
all the Knights held back while the little Duke rode alone a
little in advance of them through the gateway.&nbsp; There was a
loud shout of &ldquo;Long live the little Duke!&rdquo; and crowds
of people were standing round to gaze upon his entry, so many
that the bag of coins was soon emptied by his largesses.&nbsp;
The whole city was like one great castle, shut in by a wall and
moat, and with Rollo&rsquo;s Tower rising at one end like the
keep of a castle, and it was thither that Richard was turning his
horse, when the Count of Harcourt said, &ldquo;Nay, my Lord, to
the Church of our Lady.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>It was then considered a duty to be paid to the deceased, that
their relatives and friends should visit them as they lay in
state, and sprinkle them with drops of holy water, and Richard
was now to pay this token of respect.&nbsp; He trembled a little,
and yet it did not seem quite so dreary, since he should once
more look on his father&rsquo;s face, and he accordingly rode
towards the Cathedral.&nbsp; It was then very unlike what it is
now; the walls were very thick, the windows small and almost
buried in heavy carved arches, the columns within were low,
clumsy, and circular, and it was usually so dark that the
vaulting of the roof could scarcely be seen.</p>
<p>Now, however, a whole flood of light poured forth from every
window, and when Richard came to the door, he saw not only the
two tall thick candles that always burnt on each side of the
Altar, but in the Chancel stood a double row ranged in a square,
shedding a pure, quiet brilliancy throughout the building, and
chiefly on the silver and gold ornaments of the Altar.&nbsp;
Outside these lights knelt a row of priests in dark garments,
their heads bowed over their clasped hands, and their chanted
psalms sounding sweet, and full of soothing music.&nbsp; Within
that guarded space was a bier, and a form lay on it.</p>
<p>Richard trembled still more with awe, and would have paused,
but he was obliged to proceed.&nbsp; He dipped his hand in the
water of the font, crossed his brow, and came slowly on,
sprinkled the remaining drops on the lifeless figure, and then
stood still.&nbsp; There was an oppression on his breast as if he
could neither breathe nor move.</p>
<p>There lay William of the Long Sword, like a good and true
Christian warrior, arrayed in his shining armour, his sword by
his side, his shield on his arm, and a cross between his hands,
clasped upon his breast.&nbsp; His ducal mantle of crimson
velvet, lined with ermine, was round his shoulders, and, instead
of a helmet, his coronet was on his head; but, in contrast with
this rich array, over the collar of the hauberk, was folded the
edge of a rough hair shirt, which the Duke had worn beneath his
robes, unknown to all, until his corpse was disrobed of his
blood-stained garments.&nbsp; His face looked full of calm,
solemn peace, as if he had gently fallen asleep, and was only
awaiting the great call to awaken.&nbsp; There was not a single
token of violence visible about him, save that one side of his
forehead bore a deep purple mark, where he had first been struck
by the blow of the oar which had deprived him of sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you that, my Lord?&rdquo; said Count Bernard, first
breaking the silence, in a low, deep, stern voice.</p>
<p>Richard had heard little for many hours past save counsels
against the Flemings, and plans of bitter enmity against them;
and the sight of his murdered father, with that look and tone of
the old Dane, fired his spirit, and breaking from his trance of
silent awe and grief, he exclaimed, &ldquo;I see it, and dearly
shall the traitor Fleming abye it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, encouraged
by the applauding looks of the nobles, he proceeded, feeling like
one of the young champions of Fru Astrida&rsquo;s songs.&nbsp;
His cheek was coloured, his eye lighted up, and he lifted his
head, so that the hair fell back from his forehead; he laid his
hand on the hilt of his father&rsquo;s sword, and spoke on in
words, perhaps, suggested by some sage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, Arnulf
of Flanders, know that Duke William of Normandy shall not rest
unavenged!&nbsp; On this good sword I vow, that, as soon as my
arm shall have strength&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest was left unspoken, for a hand was laid on his
arm.&nbsp; A priest, who had hitherto been kneeling near the head
of the corpse, had risen, and stood tall and dark over him, and,
looking up, he recognized the pale, grave countenance of Martin,
Abbot of Jumi&egrave;ges, his father&rsquo;s chief friend and
councillor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard of Normandy, what sayest thou?&rdquo; said he,
sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, hang thy head, and reply not, rather
than repeat those words.&nbsp; Dost thou come here to disturb the
peace of the dead with clamours for vengeance?&nbsp; Dost thou
vow strife and anger on that sword which was never drawn, save in
the cause of the poor and distressed?&nbsp; Wouldst thou rob Him,
to whose service thy life has been pledged, and devote thyself to
that of His foe?&nbsp; Is this what thou hast learnt from thy
blessed father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard made no answer, but he covered his face with his
hands, to hide the tears which were fast streaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Abbot, Lord Abbot, this passes!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bernard the Dane.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our young Lord is no monk, and we
will not see each spark of noble and knightly spirit quenched as
soon as it shows itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count of Harcourt,&rdquo; said Abbot Martin, &ldquo;are
these the words of a savage Pagan, or of one who has been washed
in yonder blessed font?&nbsp; Never, while I have power, shalt
thou darken the child&rsquo;s soul with thy foul thirst of
revenge, insult the presence of thy master with the crime he so
abhorred, nor the temple of Him who came to pardon, with thy
hatred.&nbsp; Well do I know, ye Barons of Normandy, that each
drop of your blood would willingly be given, could it bring back
our departed Duke, or guard his orphan child; but, if ye have
loved the father, do his bidding&mdash;lay aside that accursed
spirit of hatred and vengeance; if ye love the child, seek not to
injure his soul more deeply than even his bitterest foe, were it
Arnulf himself, hath power to hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Barons were silenced, whatever their thoughts might be,
and Abbot Martin turned to Richard, whose tears were still
dropping fast through his fingers, as the thought of those last
words of his father returned more clearly upon him.&nbsp; The
Abbot laid his hand on his head, and spoke gently to him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These are tears of a softened heart, I trust,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I well believe that thou didst scarce know what
thou wert saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; said Richard, as well as he could
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there,&rdquo; said the priest, pointing to the
large Cross over the Altar, &ldquo;thou knowest the meaning of
that sacred sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard bowed his head in assent and reverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It speaks of forgiveness,&rdquo; continued the
Abbot.&nbsp; &ldquo;And knowest thou who gave that pardon?&nbsp;
The Son forgave His murderers; the Father them who slew His
Son.&nbsp; And shalt thou call for vengeance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh!&rdquo; said Richard, looking up, &ldquo;must
that cruel, murderous traitor glory unpunished in his crime,
while there lies&mdash;&rdquo; and again his voice was cut off by
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vengeance shall surely overtake the sinner,&rdquo; said
Martin, &ldquo;the vengeance of the Lord, and in His own good
time, but it must not be of thy seeking.&nbsp; Nay, Richard, thou
art of all men the most bound to show love and mercy to Arnulf of
Flanders.&nbsp; Yes, when the hand of the Lord hath touched him,
and bowed him down in punishment for his crime, it is then, that
thou, whom he hath most deeply injured, shouldst stretch out
thine hand to aid him, and receive him with pardon and
peace.&nbsp; If thou dost vow aught on the sword of thy blessed
father, in the sanctuary of thy Redeemer, let it be a Christian
vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard wept too bitterly to speak, and Bernard de Harcourt,
taking his hand, led him away from the Church.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Duke William of the Long Sword was buried the next morning in
high pomp and state, with many a prayer and psalm chanted over
his grave.</p>
<p>When this was over, little Richard, who had all the time stood
or knelt nearest the corpse, in one dull heavy dream of wonder
and sorrow, was led back to the palace, and there his long,
heavy, black garments were taken off, and he was dressed in his
short scarlet tunic, his hair was carefully arranged, and then he
came down again into the hall, where there was a great assembly
of Barons, some in armour, some in long furred gowns, who had all
been attending his father&rsquo;s burial.&nbsp; Richard, as he
was desired by Sir Eric de Centeville, took off his cap, and
bowed low in reply to the reverences with which they all greeted
his entrance, and he then slowly crossed the hall, and descended
the steps from the door, while they formed into a procession
behind him, according to their ranks&mdash;the Duke of Brittany
first, and then all the rest, down to the poorest knight who held
his manor immediately from the Duke of Normandy.</p>
<p>Thus, they proceeded, in slow and solemn order, till they came
to the church of our Lady.&nbsp; The clergy were there already,
ranged in ranks on each side of the Choir; and the Bishops, in
their mitres and rich robes, each with his pastoral staff in his
hand, were standing round the Altar.&nbsp; As the little Duke
entered, there arose from all the voices in the Chancel the full,
loud, clear chant of <i>Te Deum Laudamus</i>, echoing among the
dark vaults of the roof.&nbsp; To that sound, Richard walked up
the Choir, to a large, heavy, crossed-legged, carved chair,
raised on two steps, just before the steps of the Altar began,
and there he stood, Bernard de Harcourt and Eric de Centeville on
each side of him, and all his other vassals in due order, in the
Choir.</p>
<p>After the beautiful chant of the hymn was ended, the service
for the Holy Communion began.&nbsp; When the time came for the
offering, each noble gave gold or silver; and, lastly, Rainulf of
Ferri&egrave;res came up to the step of the Altar with a cushion,
on which was placed a circlet of gold, the ducal coronet; and
another Baron, following him closely, carried a long, heavy
sword, with a cross handle.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Rouen
received both coronet and sword, and laid them on the
Altar.&nbsp; Then the service proceeded.&nbsp; At that time the
rite of Confirmation was administered in infancy, and Richard,
who had been confirmed by his godfather, the Archbishop of Rouen,
immediately after his baptism, knelt in solemn awe to receive the
other Holy Sacrament from his hands, as soon as all the clergy
had communicated. <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>When the administration was over, Richard was led forward to
the step of the Altar by Count Bernard, and Sir Eric, and the
Archbishop, laying one hand upon both his, as he held them
clasped together, demanded of him, in the name of God, and of the
people of Normandy, whether he would be their good and true
ruler, guard them from their foes, maintain truth, punish
iniquity, and protect the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; answered Richard&rsquo;s young,
trembling voice, &ldquo;So help me God!&rdquo; and he knelt, and
kissed the book of the Holy Gospels, which the Archbishop offered
him.</p>
<p>It was a great and awful oath, and he dreaded to think that he
had taken it.&nbsp; He still knelt, put both hands over his face,
and whispered, &ldquo;O God, my Father, help me to keep
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Archbishop waited till he rose, and then, turning him with
his face to the people, said, &ldquo;Richard, by the grace of
God, I invest thee with the ducal mantle of Normandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the Bishops then hung round his shoulders a crimson
velvet mantle, furred with ermine, which, made as it was for a
grown man, hung heavily on the poor child&rsquo;s shoulders, and
lay in heaps on the ground.&nbsp; The Archbishop then set the
golden coronet on his long, flowing hair, where it hung so
loosely on the little head, that Sir Eric was obliged to put his
hand to it to hold it safe; and, lastly, the long, straight,
two-handed sword was brought and placed in his hand, with another
solemn bidding to use it ever in maintaining the right.&nbsp; It
should have been girded to his side, but the great sword was so
much taller than the little Duke, that, as it stood upright by
him, he was obliged to raise his arm to put it round the
handle.</p>
<p>He then had to return to his throne, which was not done
without some difficulty, encumbered as he was, but Osmond held up
the train of his mantle, Sir Eric kept the coronet on his head,
and he himself held fast and lovingly the sword, though the Count
of Harcourt offered to carry it for him.&nbsp; He was lifted up
to his throne, and then came the paying him homage; Alan, Duke of
Brittany, was the first to kneel before him, and with his hand
between those of the Duke, he swore to be his man, to obey him,
and pay him feudal service for his dukedom of Brittany.&nbsp; In
return, Richard swore to be his good Lord, and to protect him
from all his foes.&nbsp; Then followed Bernard the Dane, and many
another, each repeating the same formulary, as their large rugged
hands were clasped within those little soft fingers.&nbsp; Many a
kind and loving eye was bent in compassion on the orphan child;
many a strong voice faltered with earnestness as it pronounced
the vow, and many a brave, stalwart heart heaved with grief for
the murdered father, and tears flowed down the war-worn cheeks
which had met the fiercest storms of the northern ocean, as they
bent before the young fatherless boy, whom they loved for the
sake of his conquering grandfather, and his brave and pious
father.&nbsp; Few Normans were there whose hearts did not glow at
the touch of those small hands, with a love almost of a parent,
for their young Duke.</p>
<p>The ceremony of receiving homage lasted long and Richard,
though interested and touched at first, grew very weary; the
crown and mantle were so heavy, the faces succeeded each other
like figures in an endless dream, and the constant repetition of
the same words was very tedious.&nbsp; He grew sleepy, he longed
to jump up, to lean to the right or left, or to speak something
besides that regular form.&nbsp; He gave one great yawn, but it
brought him such a frown from the stern face of Bernard, as quite
to wake him for a few minutes, and make him sit upright, and
receive the next vassal with as much attention as he had shown
the first, but he looked imploringly at Sir Eric, as if to ask if
it ever would be over.&nbsp; At last, far down among the Barons,
came one at whose sight Richard revived a little.&nbsp; It was a
boy only a few years older than himself, perhaps about ten, with
a pleasant brown face, black hair, and quick black eyes which
glanced, with a look between friendliness and respect, up into
the little Duke&rsquo;s gazing face.&nbsp; Richard listened
eagerly for his name, and was refreshed at the sound of the
boyish voice which pronounced, &ldquo;I, Alberic de
Mont&eacute;mar, am thy liegeman and vassal for my castle and
barony of Mont&eacute;mar sur Epte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Alberic moved away, Richard followed him with his eye as
far as he could to his place in the Cathedral, and was taken by
surprise when he found the next Baron kneeling before him.</p>
<p>The ceremony of homage came to an end at last, and Richard
would fain have run all the way to the palace to shake off his
weariness, but he was obliged to head the procession again; and
even when he reached the castle hall his toils were not over, for
there was a great state banquet spread out, and he had to sit in
the high chair where he remembered climbing on his father&rsquo;s
knee last Christmas-day, all the time that the Barons feasted
round, and held grave converse.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s best
comfort all this time was in watching Osmond de Centeville and
Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar, who, with the other youths who were
not yet knighted, were waiting on those who sat at the
table.&nbsp; At last he grew so very weary, that he fell fast
asleep in the corner of his chair, and did not wake till he was
startled by the rough voice of Bernard de Harcourt, calling him
to rouse up, and bid the Duke of Brittany farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Duke Alan, as Richard rose up,
startled, &ldquo;he is over-wearied with this day&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; Take care of him, Count Bernard; thou a kindly nurse,
but a rough one for such a babe.&nbsp; Ha! my young Lord, your
colour mantles at being called a babe!&nbsp; I crave your pardon,
for you are a fine spirit.&nbsp; And hark you, Lord Richard of
Normandy, I have little cause to love your race, and little
right, I trow, had King Charles the Simple to call us free
Bretons liegemen to a race of plundering Northern pirates.&nbsp;
To Duke Rollo&rsquo;s might, my father never gave his homage;
nay, nor did I yield it for all Duke William&rsquo;s long sword,
but I did pay it to his generosity and forbearance, and now I
grant it to thy weakness and to his noble memory.&nbsp; I doubt
not that the recreant Frank, Louis, whom he restored to his
throne, will strive to profit by thy youth and helplessness, and
should that be, remember that thou hast no surer friend than Alan
of Brittany.&nbsp; Fare thee well, my young Duke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Sir,&rdquo; said Richard, willingly giving
his hand to be shaken by his kind vassal, and watching him as Sir
Eric attended him from the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair words, but I trust not the Breton,&rdquo; muttered
Bernard; &ldquo;hatred is deeply ingrained in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should know what the Frank King is made of,&rdquo;
said Rainulf de Ferri&egrave;res; &ldquo;he was bred up with him
in the days that they were both exiles at the court of King
Ethelstane of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and thanks to Duke William that either Louis or
Alan are not exiles still.&nbsp; Now we shall see whose gratitude
is worth most, the Frank&rsquo;s or the Breton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I
suspect the Norman valour will be the best to trust
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and how will Norman valour prosper without
treasure?&nbsp; Who knows what gold is in the Duke&rsquo;s
coffers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some consultation here in a low voice, and the next
thing Richard heard distinctly was, that one of the Nobles held
up a silver chain and key, <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a> saying that they had
been found on the Duke&rsquo;s neck, and that he had kept them,
thinking that they doubtless led to something of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Richard, eagerly, &ldquo;I know
it.&nbsp; He told me it was the key to his greatest
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Normans heard this with great interest, and it was
resolved that several of the most trusted persons, among whom
were the Archbishop of Rouen, Abbot Martin of Jumi&egrave;ges,
and the Count of Harcourt, should go immediately in search of
this precious hoard.&nbsp; Richard accompanied them up the narrow
rough stone stairs, to the large dark apartment, where his father
had slept.&nbsp; Though a Prince&rsquo;s chamber, it had little
furniture; a low uncurtained bed, a Cross on a ledge near its
head, a rude table, a few chairs, and two large chests, were all
it contained.&nbsp; Harcourt tried the lid of one of the chests:
it opened, and proved to be full of wearing apparel; he went to
the other, which was smaller, much more carved, and ornamented
with very handsome iron-work.&nbsp; It was locked, and putting in
the key, it fitted, the lock turned, and the chest was
opened.&nbsp; The Normans pressed eagerly to see their
Duke&rsquo;s greatest treasure.</p>
<p>It was a robe of serge, and a pair of sandals, such as were
worn in the Abbey of Jumi&egrave;ges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! is this all?&nbsp; What didst say, child?&rdquo;
cried Bernard the Dane, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me it was his greatest treasure!&rdquo;
repeated Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was!&rdquo; said Abbot Martin.</p>
<p>Then the good Abbot told them the history, part of which was
already known to some of them.&nbsp; About five or six years
before, Duke William had been hunting in the forest of
Jumi&egrave;ges, when he had suddenly come on the ruins of the
Abbey, which had been wasted thirty or forty years previously by
the Sea-King, Hasting.&nbsp; Two old monks, of the original
brotherhood, still survived, and came forth to greet the Duke,
and offer him their hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said Bernard, &ldquo;well do I remember
their bread; we asked if it was made of fir-bark, like that of
our brethren of Norway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William, then an eager, thoughtless young man, turned with
disgust from this wretched fare, and throwing the old men some
gold, galloped on to enjoy his hunting.&nbsp; In the course of
the sport, he was left alone, and encountered a wild boar, which
threw him down, trampled on him, and left him stretched senseless
on the ground, severely injured.&nbsp; His companions coming up,
carried him, as the nearest place of shelter, to the ruins of
Jumi&egrave;ges, where the two old monks gladly received him in
the remaining portion of their house.&nbsp; As soon as he
recovered his senses, he earnestly asked their pardon for his
pride, and the scorn he had shown to the poverty and patient
suffering which he should have reverenced.</p>
<p>William had always been a man who chose the good and refused
the evil, but this accident, and the long illness that followed
it, made him far more thoughtful and serious than he had ever
been before; he made preparing for death and eternity his first
object, and thought less of his worldly affairs, his wars, and
his ducal state.&nbsp; He rebuilt the old Abbey, endowed it
richly, and sent for Martin himself from France, to become the
Abbot; he delighted in nothing so much as praying there,
conversing with the Abbot, and hearing him read holy books; and
he felt his temporal affairs, and the state and splendour of his
rank, so great a temptation, that he had one day come to the
Abbot, and entreated to be allowed to lay them aside, and become
a brother of the order.&nbsp; But Martin had refused to receive
his vows.&nbsp; He had told him that he had no right to neglect
or forsake the duties of the station which God had appointed him;
that it would be a sin to leave the post which had been given him
to defend; and that the way marked out for him to serve God was
by doing justice among his people, and using his power to defend
the right.&nbsp; Not till he had done his allotted work, and his
son was old enough to take his place as ruler of the Normans,
might he cease from his active duties, quit the turmoil of the
world, and seek the repose of the cloister.&nbsp; It was in this
hope of peaceful retirement, that William had delighted to
treasure up the humble garments that he hoped one day to wear in
peace and holiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And oh! my noble Duke!&rdquo; exclaimed Abbot Martin,
bursting into tears, as he finished his narration, &ldquo;the
Lord hath been very gracious unto thee!&nbsp; He has taken thee
home to thy rest, long before thou didst dare to hope for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, and with subdued feelings, the Norman Barons left the
chamber; Richard, whom they seemed to have almost forgotten,
wandered to the stairs, to find his way to the room where he had
slept last night.&nbsp; He had not made many steps before he
heard Osmond&rsquo;s voice say, &ldquo;Here, my Lord;&rdquo; he
looked up, saw a white cap at a doorway a little above him, he
bounded up and flew into Dame Astrida&rsquo;s outstretched
arms.</p>
<p>How glad he was to sit in her lap, and lay his wearied head on
her bosom, while, with a worn-out voice, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh,
Fru Astrida!&nbsp; I am very, very tired of being Duke of
Normandy!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>Richard of Normandy was very anxious to know more of the
little boy whom he had seen among his vassals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the young Baron de Mont&eacute;mar,&rdquo; said Sir
Eric.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew his father well, and a brave man he
was, though not of northern blood.&nbsp; He was warden of the
marches of the Epte, and was killed by your father&rsquo;s side
in the inroad of the Viscount du Cotentin, <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a> at the time when you were born, Lord
Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where does he live?&nbsp; Shall I not see him
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mont&eacute;mar is on the bank of the Epte, in the
domain that the French wrongfully claim from us.&nbsp; He lives
there with his mother, and if he be not yet returned, you shall
see him presently.&nbsp; Osmond, go you and seek out the lodgings
of the young Mont&eacute;mar, and tell him the Duke would see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard had never had a playfellow of his own age, and his
eagerness to see Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar was great.&nbsp; He
watched from the window, and at length beheld Osmond entering the
court with a boy of ten years old by his side, and an old
grey-headed Squire, with a golden chain to mark him as a
Seneschal or Steward of the Castle, walking behind.</p>
<p>Richard ran to the door to meet them, holding out his hand
eagerly.&nbsp; Alberic uncovered his bright dark hair, bowed low
and gracefully, but stood as if he did not exactly know what to
do next.&nbsp; Richard grew shy at the same moment, and the two
boys stood looking at each other somewhat awkwardly.&nbsp; It was
easy to see that they were of different races, so unlike were the
blue eyes, flaxen hair, and fair face of the young Duke, to the
black flashing eyes and olive cheek of his French vassal, who,
though two years older, was scarcely above him in height; and his
slight figure, well-proportioned, active and agile as it was, did
not give the same promise of strength as the round limbs and
large-boned frame of Richard, which even now seemed likely to
rival the gigantic stature of his grandfather, Earl Rollo, the
Ganger.</p>
<p>For some minutes the little Duke and the young Baron stood
surveying each other without a word, and old Sir Eric did not
improve matters by saying, &ldquo;Well, Lord Duke, here he
is.&nbsp; Have you no better greeting for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children are shame-faced,&rdquo; said Fru Astrida,
seeing how they both coloured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is your Lady mother
in good health, my young sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberic blushed more deeply, bowed to the old northern lady,
and answered fast and low in French, &ldquo;I cannot speak the
Norman tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard, glad to say something, interpreted Fru
Astrida&rsquo;s speech, and Alberic readily made courteous reply
that his mother was well, and he thanked the Dame de Centeville,
a French title which sounded new to Fru Astrida&rsquo;s
ears.&nbsp; Then came the embarrassment again, and Fru Astrida at
last said, &ldquo;Take him out, Lord Richard; take him to see the
horses in the stables, or the hounds, or what not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard was not sorry to obey, so out they went into the court
of Rollo&rsquo;s tower, and in the open air the shyness went
off.&nbsp; Richard showed his own pony, and Alberic asked if he
could leap into the saddle without putting his foot in the
stirrup.&nbsp; No, Richard could not; indeed, even Osmond had
never seen it done, for the feats of French chivalry had scarcely
yet spread into Normandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;will you show
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I can with my own pony,&rdquo; said Alberic,
&ldquo;for Bertrand will not let me mount in any other way; but I
will try with yours, if you desire it, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the pony was led out.&nbsp; Alberic laid one hand on its
mane, and vaulted on its back in a moment.&nbsp; Both Osmond and
Richard broke out loudly into admiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, this
is nothing!&rdquo; said Alberic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bertrand says it is
nothing.&nbsp; Before he grew old and stiff he could spring into
the saddle in this manner fully armed.&nbsp; I ought to do this
much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard begged to be shown how to perform the exploit, and
Alberic repeated it; then Richard wanted to try, but the
pony&rsquo;s patience would not endure any longer, and Alberic
said he had learnt on a block of wood, and practised on the great
wolf-hound.&nbsp; They wandered about a little longer in the
court, and then climbed up the spiral stone stairs to the
battlements at the top of the tower, where they looked at the
house-tops of Rouen close beneath, and the river Seine,
broadening and glittering on one side in its course to the sea,
and on the other narrowing to a blue ribbon, winding through the
green expanse of fertile Normandy.&nbsp; They threw the pebbles
and bits of mortar down that they might hear them fall, and tried
which could stand nearest to the edge of the battlement without
being giddy.&nbsp; Richard was pleased to find that he could go
the nearest, and began to tell some of Fru Astrida&rsquo;s
stories about the precipices of Norway, among which when she was
a young girl she used to climb about and tend the cattle in the
long light summer time.&nbsp; When the two boys came down again
into the hall to dinner, they felt as if they had known each
other all their lives.&nbsp; The dinner was laid out in full
state, and Richard had, as before, to sit in the great
throne-like chair with the old Count of Harcourt on one side,
but, to his comfort, Fru Astrida was on the other.</p>
<p>After the dinner, Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar rose to take his
leave, as he was to ride half way to his home that
afternoon.&nbsp; Count Bernard, who all dinner time had been
watching him intently from under his shaggy eye-brows, at this
moment turned to Richard, whom he hardly ever addressed, and said
to him, &ldquo;Hark ye, my Lord, what should you say to have him
yonder for a comrade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To stay with me?&rdquo; cried Richard, eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, thanks, Sir Count; and may he stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Lord here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Alberic!&rdquo; cried Richard, jumping out of his
chair of state, and running up to him, &ldquo;will you not stay
with me, and be my brother and comrade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alberic looked down hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say that you will!&nbsp; I will give you horses,
and hawks, and hounds, and I will love you&mdash;almost as well
as Osmond.&nbsp; Oh, stay with me, Alberic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must obey you, my Lord,&rdquo; said Alberic,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, young Frenchman, out with it,&rdquo; said
Bernard,&mdash;&ldquo;no buts!&nbsp; Speak honestly, and at once,
like a Norman, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This rough speech seemed to restore the little Baron&rsquo;s
self-possession, and he looked up bright and bold at the rugged
face of the old Dane, while he said, &ldquo;I had rather not stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! not do service to your Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would serve him with all my heart, but I do not want
to stay here.&nbsp; I love the Castle of Mont&eacute;mar better,
and my mother has no one but me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave and true, Sir Frenchman,&rdquo; said the old
Count, laying his great hand on Alberic&rsquo;s head, and looking
better pleased than Richard thought his grim features could have
appeared.&nbsp; Then turning to Bertrand, Alberic&rsquo;s
Seneschal, he said, &ldquo;Bear the Count de Harcourt&rsquo;s
greetings to the noble Dame de Mont&eacute;mar, and say to her
that her son is of a free bold spirit, and if she would have him
bred up with my Lord Duke, as his comrade and brother in arms, he
will find a ready welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Alberic, you will come back, perhaps?&rdquo; said
Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be as my mother pleases,&rdquo; answered
Alberic bluntly, and with all due civilities he and his Seneschal
departed.</p>
<p>Four or five times a day did Richard ask Osmond and Fru
Astrida if they thought Alberic would return, and it was a great
satisfaction to him to find that every one agreed that it would
be very foolish in the Dame de Mont&eacute;mar to refuse so good
an offer, only Fru Astrida could not quite believe she would part
with her son.&nbsp; Still no Baron de Mont&eacute;mar arrived,
and the little Duke was beginning to think less about his hopes,
when one evening, as he was returning from a ride with Sir Eric
and Osmond, he saw four horsemen coming towards them, and a
little boy in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Alberic himself, I am sure of it!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, and so it proved; and while the Seneschal delivered
his Lady&rsquo;s message to Sir Eric, Richard rode up and greeted
the welcome guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am very glad your mother has sent you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she was not fit to bring up a young warrior of
the marches,&rdquo; said Alberic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you very sorry to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say I shall not mind it soon; and Bertrand is to
come and fetch me home to visit her every three months, if you
will let me go, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard was extremely delighted, and thought he could never do
enough to make Rouen pleasant to Alberic, who after the first day
or two cheered up, missed his mother less, managed to talk
something between French and Norman to Sir Eric and Fru Astrida,
and became a very animated companion and friend.&nbsp; In one
respect Alberic was a better playfellow for the Duke than Osmond
de Centeville, for Osmond, playing as a grown up man, not for his
own amusement, but the child&rsquo;s, had left all the advantages
of the game to Richard, who was growing not a little inclined to
domineer.&nbsp; This Alberic did not like, unless, as he said,
&ldquo;it was to be always Lord and vassal, and then he did not
care for the game,&rdquo; and he played with so little animation
that Richard grew vexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Alberic; &ldquo;if
you take all the best chances to yourself, &rsquo;tis no sport
for me.&nbsp; I will do your bidding, as you are the Duke, but I
cannot like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind my being Duke, but play as we used to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us play as I did with Bertrand&rsquo;s sons at
Mont&eacute;mar.&nbsp; I was their Baron, as you are my Duke, but
my mother said there would be no sport unless we forgot all that
at play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then so we will.&nbsp; Come, begin again, Alberic, and
you shall have the first turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Alberic was quite as courteous and respectful to the
Duke when they were not at play, as the difference of their rank
required; indeed, he had learnt much more of grace and
courtliness of demeanour from his mother, a Proven&ccedil;al
lady, than was yet to be found among the Normans.&nbsp; The
Chaplain of Mont&eacute;mar had begun to teach him to read and
write, and he liked learning much better than Richard, who would
not have gone on with Father Lucas&rsquo;s lessons at all, if
Abbot Martin of Jumi&egrave;ges had not put him in mind that it
had been his father&rsquo;s especial desire.</p>
<p>What Richard most disliked was, however, the being obliged to
sit in council.&nbsp; The Count of Harcourt did in truth govern
the dukedom, but nothing could be done without the Duke&rsquo;s
consent, and once a week at least, there was held in the great
hall of Rollo&rsquo;s tower, what was called a <i>Parlement</i>,
or &ldquo;a talkation,&rdquo; where Count Bernard, the
Archbishop, the Baron de Centeville, the Abbot of
Jumi&egrave;ges, and such other Bishops, Nobles, or Abbots, as
might chance to be at Rouen, consulted on the affairs of
Normandy; and there the little Duke always was forced to be
present, sitting up in his chair of state, and hearing rather
than listening to, questions about the repairing and guarding of
Castles, the asking of loans from the vassals, the appeals from
the Barons of the Exchequer, who were then Nobles sent through
the duchy to administer justice, and the discussions about the
proceedings of his neighbours, King Louis of France, Count
Foulques of Anjou, and Count Herluin of Montreuil, and how far
the friendship of Hugh of Paris, and Alan of Brittany might be
trusted.</p>
<p>Very tired of all this did Richard grow, especially when he
found that the Normans had made up their minds not to attempt a
war against the wicked Count of Flanders.&nbsp; He sighed most
wearily, yawned again and again, and moved restlessly about in
his chair; but whenever Count Bernard saw him doing so, he
received so severe a look and sign that he grew perfectly to
dread the eye of the fierce old Dane.&nbsp; Bernard never spoke
to him to praise him, or to enter into any of his pursuits; he
only treated him with the grave distant respect due to him as a
Prince, or else now and then spoke a few stern words to him of
reproof for this restlessness, or for some other childish
folly.</p>
<p>Used as Richard was to be petted and made much of by the whole
house of Centeville, he resented this considerably in secret,
disliked and feared the old Count, and more than once told
Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar, that as soon as he was fourteen, when
he would be declared of age, he should send Count Bernard to take
care of his own Castle of Harcourt, instead of letting him sit
gloomy and grim in the Castle hall in the evening, spoiling all
their sport.</p>
<p>Winter had set in, and Osmond used daily to take the little
Duke and Alberic to the nearest sheet of ice, for the Normans
still prided themselves on excelling in skating, though they had
long since left the frost-bound streams and lakes of Norway.</p>
<p>One day, as they were returning from the ice, they were
surprised, even before they entered the Castle court, by hearing
the trampling of horses&rsquo; feet, and a sound of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What may this mean?&rdquo; said Osmond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There must surely be a great arrival of the vassals.&nbsp;
The Duke of Brittany, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Richard, piteously, &ldquo;we have had
one council already this week.&nbsp; I hope another is not
coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must import something extraordinary,&rdquo;
proceeded Osmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a mischance that the Count
of Harcourt is not at Rouen just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard thought this no mischance at all, and just then,
Alberic, who had run on a little before, came back exclaiming,
&ldquo;They are French.&nbsp; It is the Frank tongue, not the
Norman, that they speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So please you, my Lord,&rdquo; said Osmond, stopping
short, &ldquo;we go not rashly into the midst of them.&nbsp; I
would I knew what were best to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond rubbed his forehead and stood considering, while the
two boys looked at him anxiously.&nbsp; In a few seconds, before
he had come to any conclusion, there came forth from the gate a
Norman Squire, accompanied by two strangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord Duke,&rdquo; said he to Richard, in French,
&ldquo;Sir Eric has sent me to bring you tidings that the King of
France has arrived to receive your homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King!&rdquo; exclaimed Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; proceeded the Norman, in his own tongue,
&ldquo;Louis himself, and with a train looking bent on
mischief.&nbsp; I wish it may portend good to my Lord here.&nbsp;
You see I am accompanied.&nbsp; I believe from my heart that
Louis meant to prevent you from receiving a warning, and taking
the boy out of his clutches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! what?&rdquo; said Richard, anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why is the King come?&nbsp; What must I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on now, since there is no help for it,&rdquo; said
Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greet the king as becomes you, bend the knee, and pay
him homage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard repeated over to himself the form of homage that he
might be perfect in it, and walked on into the court; Alberic,
Osmond, and the rest falling back as he entered.&nbsp; The court
was crowded with horses and men, and it was only by calling out
loudly, &ldquo;The Duke, the Duke,&rdquo; that Osmond could get
space enough made for them to pass.&nbsp; In a few moments
Richard had mounted the steps and stood in the great hall.</p>
<p>In the chair of state, at the upper end of the room, sat a
small spare man, of about eight or nine-and-twenty, pale, and of
a light complexion, with a rich dress of blue and gold.&nbsp; Sir
Eric and several other persons stood respectfully round him, and
he was conversing with the Archbishop, who, as well as Sir Eric,
cast several anxious glances at the little Duke as he advanced up
the hall.&nbsp; He came up to the King, put his knee to the
ground, and was just beginning, &ldquo;Louis, King of France,
I&mdash;&rdquo; when he found himself suddenly lifted from the
ground in the King&rsquo;s arms, and kissed on both cheeks.&nbsp;
Then setting him on his knee, the King exclaimed, &ldquo;And is
this the son of my brave and noble friend, Duke William?&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; I should have known it from his likeness.&nbsp; Let me
embrace you again, dear child, for your father&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard was rather overwhelmed, but he thought the King very
kind, especially when Louis began to admire his height and
free-spirited bearing, and to lament that his own sons, Lothaire
and Carloman, were so much smaller and more backward.&nbsp; He
caressed Richard again and again, praised every word he
said&mdash;Fru Astrida was nothing to him; and Richard began to
say to himself how strange and unkind it was of Bernard de
Harcourt to like to find fault with him, when, on the contrary,
he deserved all this praise from the King himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>Duke Richard of Normandy slept in the room which had been his
father&rsquo;s; Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar, as his page, slept at
his feet, and Osmond de Centeville had a bed on the floor, across
the door, where he lay with his sword close at hand, as his young
Lord&rsquo;s guard and protector.</p>
<p>All had been asleep for some little time, when Osmond was
startled by a slight movement of the door, which could not be
pushed open without awakening him.&nbsp; In an instant he had
grasped his sword, while he pressed his shoulder to the door to
keep it closed; but it was his father&rsquo;s voice that answered
him with a few whispered words in the Norse tongue, &ldquo;It is
I, open.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made way instantly, and old Sir Eric
entered, treading cautiously with bare feet, and sat down on the
bed motioning him to do the same, so that they might be able to
speak lower.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right, Osmond,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is well to be on the alert, for peril enough is around
him&mdash;The Frank means mischief!&nbsp; I know from a sure hand
that Arnulf of Flanders was in council with him just before he
came hither, with his false tongue, wiling and coaxing the poor
child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ungrateful traitor!&rdquo; murmured Osmond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you guess his purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, surely, to carry the boy off with him, and so he
trusts doubtless to cut off all the race of Rollo!&nbsp; I know
his purpose is to bear off the Duke, as a ward of the Crown
forsooth.&nbsp; Did you not hear him luring the child with his
promises of friendship with the Princes?&nbsp; I could not
understand all his French words, but I saw it plain
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never allow it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, it must be across our dead bodies; but
taken as we are by surprise, our resistance will little
avail.&nbsp; The Castle is full of French, the hall and court
swarm with them.&nbsp; Even if we could draw our Normans
together, we should not be more than a dozen men, and what could
we do but die?&nbsp; That we are ready for, if it may not be
otherwise, rather than let our charge be thus borne off without a
pledge for his safety, and without the knowledge of the
states.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king could not have come at a worse time,&rdquo;
said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just when Bernard the Dane is absent.&nbsp; If he
only knew what has befallen, he could raise the country, and come
to the rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we not send some one to bear the tidings
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said Sir Eric, musingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The French have taken the keeping of the doors; indeed
they are so thick through the Castle that I can hardly reach one
of our men, nor could I spare one hand that may avail to guard
the boy to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Eric;&rdquo; a bare little foot was heard on the
floor, and Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar stood before him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I did not mean to listen, but I could not help hearing
you.&nbsp; I cannot fight for the Duke yet, but I could carry a
message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would that be?&rdquo; said Osmond, eagerly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Once out of the Castle, and in Rouen, he could easily find
means of sending to the Count.&nbsp; He might go either to the
Convent of St. Ouen, or, which would be better, to the trusty
armourer, Thibault, who would soon find man and horse to send
after the Count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! let me see,&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
might be.&nbsp; But how is he to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a way,&rdquo; said Alberic.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
scrambled down that wide buttress by the east wall last week,
when our ball was caught in a branch of the ivy, and the
drawbridge is down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Bernard knew, it would be off my mind, at
least!&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, my young
Frenchman, you may do good service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Osmond,&rdquo; whispered Alberic, as he began hastily
to dress himself, &ldquo;only ask one thing of Sir
Eric&mdash;never to call me young Frenchman again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Eric smiled, saying, &ldquo;Prove yourself Norman, my
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; added Osmond, &ldquo;if it were possible
to get the Duke himself out of the castle to-morrow
morning.&nbsp; If I could take him forth by the postern, and once
bring him into the town, he would be safe.&nbsp; It would be only
to raise the burghers, or else to take refuge in the Church of
Our Lady till the Count came up, and then Louis would find his
prey out of his hands when he awoke and sought him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be,&rdquo; replied Sir Eric; &ldquo;but I
doubt your success.&nbsp; The French are too eager to hold him
fast, to let him slip out of their hands.&nbsp; You will find
every door guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but all the French have not seen the Duke, and the
sight of a squire and a little page going forth, will scarcely
excite their suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, if the Duke would bear himself like a little page;
but that you need not hope for.&nbsp; Besides, he is so taken
with this King&rsquo;s flatteries, that I doubt whether he would
consent to leave him for the sake of Count Bernard.&nbsp; Poor
child, he is like to be soon taught to know his true
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Alberic, coming forward.</p>
<p>The Baron de Centeville repeated his instructions, and then
undertook to guard the door, while his son saw Alberic set off on
his expedition.&nbsp; Osmond went with him softly down the
stairs, then avoiding the hall, which was filled with French,
they crept silently to a narrow window, guarded by iron bars,
placed at such short intervals apart that only so small and slim
a form as Alberic&rsquo;s could have squeezed out between
them.&nbsp; The distance to the ground was not much more than
twice his own height, and the wall was so covered with ivy, that
it was not a very dangerous feat for an active boy, so that
Alberic was soon safe on the ground, then looking up to wave his
cap, he ran on along the side of the moat, and was soon lost to
Osmond&rsquo;s sight in the darkness.</p>
<p>Osmond returned to the Duke&rsquo;s chamber, and relieved his
father&rsquo;s guard, while Richard slept soundly on, little
guessing at the plots of his enemies, or at the schemes of his
faithful subjects for his protection.</p>
<p>Osmond thought this all the better, for he had small trust in
Richard&rsquo;s patience and self-command, and thought there was
much more chance of getting him unnoticed out of the Castle, if
he did not know how much depended on it, and how dangerous his
situation was.</p>
<p>When Richard awoke, he was much surprised at missing Alberic,
but Osmond said he was gone into the town to Thibault the
armourer, and this was a message on which he was so likely to be
employed that Richard&rsquo;s suspicion was not excited.&nbsp;
All the time he was dressing he talked about the King, and
everything he meant to show him that day; then, when he was
ready, the first thing was as usual to go to attend morning
mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by that way, to-day, my Lord,&rdquo; said Osmond,
as Richard was about to enter the great hall.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
crowded with the French who have been sleeping there all night;
come to the postern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond turned, as he spoke, along the passage, walking fast,
and not sorry that Richard was lingering a little, as it was
safer for him to be first.&nbsp; The postern was, as he expected,
guarded by two tall steel-cased figures, who immediately held
their lances across the door-way, saying, &ldquo;None passes
without warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will surely let us of the Castle attend to our
daily business,&rdquo; said Osmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will hardly
break your fast this morning if you stop all communication with
the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must bring warrant,&rdquo; repeated one of the
men-at-arms.&nbsp; Osmond was beginning to say that he was the
son of the Seneschal of the Castle, when Richard came hastily
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&nbsp; Do these men want to stop us?&rdquo;
he exclaimed in the imperious manner he had begun to take up
since his accession.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us go on, sirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men-at-arms looked at each other, and guarded the door
more closely.&nbsp; Osmond saw it was hopeless, and only wanted
to draw his young charge back without being recognised, but
Richard exclaimed loudly, &ldquo;What means this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King has given orders that none should pass without
warrant,&rdquo; was Osmond&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will pass!&rdquo; said Richard, impatient at
opposition, to which he was little accustomed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
mean you, Osmond?&nbsp; This is my Castle, and no one has a right
to stop me.&nbsp; Do you hear, grooms? let me go.&nbsp; I am the
Duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentinels bowed, but all they said was, &ldquo;Our orders
are express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I am Duke of Normandy, and I will go where I
please in my own city!&rdquo; exclaimed Richard, passionately
pressing against the crossed staves of the weapons, to force his
way between them, but he was caught and held fast in the powerful
gauntlet of one of the men-at-arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me go,
villain!&rdquo; cried he, struggling with all his might.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Osmond, Osmond, help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke Osmond had disengaged him from the grasp of
the Frenchman, and putting his hand on his arm, said, &ldquo;Nay,
my Lord, it is not for you to strive with such as
these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will strive!&rdquo; cried the boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will not have my way barred in my own Castle.&nbsp; I will tell
the King how these rogues of his use me.&nbsp; I will have them
in the dungeon.&nbsp; Sir Eric! where is Sir Eric?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away he rushed to the stairs, Osmond hurrying after him, lest
he should throw himself into some fresh danger, or by his loud
calls attract the French, who might then easily make him
prisoner.&nbsp; However, on the very first step of the stairs
stood Sir Eric, who was too anxious for the success of the
attempt to escape, to be very far off.&nbsp; Richard, too angry
to heed where he was going, dashed up against him without seeing
him, and as the old Baron took hold of him, began, &ldquo;Sir
Eric, Sir Eric, those French are villains! they will not let me
pass&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush! my Lord,&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Silence! come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However imperious with others, Richard from force of habit
always obeyed Sir Eric, and now allowed himself to be dragged
hastily and silently by him, Osmond following closely, up the
stairs, up a second and a third winding flight, still narrower,
and with broken steps, to a small round, thick-walled turret
chamber, with an extremely small door, and loop-holes of windows
high up in the tower.&nbsp; Here, to his great surprise, he found
Dame Astrida, kneeling and telling her beads, two or three of her
maidens, and about four of the Norman Squires and
men-at-arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have failed, Osmond?&rdquo; said the Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is all this?&nbsp; How did Fru Astrida come up
here?&nbsp; May I not go to the King and have those insolent
Franks punished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Lord Richard,&rdquo; said Sir Eric:
&ldquo;that smooth-spoken King whose words so charmed you last
night is an ungrateful deceiver.&nbsp; The Franks have always
hated and feared the Normans, and not being able to conquer us
fairly, they now take to foul means.&nbsp; Louis came hither from
Flanders, he has brought this great troop of French to surprise
us, claim you as a ward of the crown, and carry you away with him
to some prison of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not let me go?&rdquo; said Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I live,&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Alberic is gone to warn the Count of Harcourt, to call the
Normans together, and here we are ready to defend this chamber to
our last breath, but we are few, the French are many, and succour
may be far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you meant to have taken me out of their reach this
morning, Osmond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I had not flown into a passion and told who I
was, I might have been safe!&nbsp; O Sir Eric!&nbsp; Sir Eric!
you will not let me be carried off to a French prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my child,&rdquo; said Dame Astrida, holding out
her arms, &ldquo;Sir Eric will do all he can for you, but we are
in God&rsquo;s hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard came and leant against her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I had
not been in a passion!&rdquo; said he, sadly, after a silence;
then looking at her in wonder&mdash;&ldquo;But how came you up
all this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long way for my old limbs,&rdquo; said Fru
Astrida, smiling, &ldquo;but my son helped me, and he deems it
the only safe place in the Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safest,&rdquo; said Sir Eric, &ldquo;and that is
not saying much for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Osmond, &ldquo;what a tramping the
Franks are making.&nbsp; They are beginning to wonder where the
Duke is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the stairs, Osmond,&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp;
&ldquo;On that narrow step one man may keep them at bay a long
time.&nbsp; You can speak their jargon too, and hold parley with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they will think I am gone,&rdquo; whispered
Richard, &ldquo;if they cannot find me, and go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond and two of the Normans were, as he spoke, taking their
stand on the narrow spiral stair, where there was just room for
one man on the step.&nbsp; Osmond was the lowest, the other two
above him, and it would have been very hard for an enemy to force
his way past them.</p>
<p>Osmond could plainly hear the sounds of the steps and voices
of the French as they consulted together, and sought for the
Duke.&nbsp; A man at length was heard clanking up these very
stairs, till winding round, he suddenly found himself close upon
young de Centeville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Norman!&rdquo; he cried, starting back in
amazement, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My duty,&rdquo; answered Osmond, shortly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am here to guard this stair;&rdquo; and his drawn sword
expressed the same intention.</p>
<p>The Frenchman drew back, and presently a whispering below was
heard, and soon after a voice came up the stairs, saying,
&ldquo;Norman&mdash;good Norman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you say?&rdquo; replied Osmond, and the head
of another Frank appeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;What means all this, my
friend?&rdquo; was the address.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our King comes as a
guest to you, and you received him last evening as loyal
vassals.&nbsp; Wherefore have you now drawn out of the way, and
striven to bear off your young Duke into secret places?&nbsp;
Truly it looks not well that you should thus strive to keep him
apart, and therefore the King requires to see him
instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Frenchman,&rdquo; replied Osmond, &ldquo;your King
claims the Duke as his ward.&nbsp; How that may be my father
knows not, but as he was committed to his charge by the states of
Normandy, he holds himself bound to keep him in his own hands
until further orders from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means, insolent Norman, that you intend to shut
the boy up and keep him in your own rebel hands.&nbsp; You had
best yield&mdash;it will be the better for you and for him.&nbsp;
The child is the King&rsquo;s ward, and he shall not be left to
be nurtured in rebellion by northern pirates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment a cry from without arose, so loud as almost to
drown the voices of the speakers on the turret stair, a cry
welcome to the ears of Osmond, repeated by a multitude of voices,
&ldquo;Haro!&nbsp; Haro! our little Duke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was well known as a Norman shout.&nbsp; So just and so
ready to redress all grievances had the old Duke Rollo been, that
his very name was an appeal against injustice, and whenever wrong
was done, the Norman outcry against the injury was always
&ldquo;Ha Rollo!&rdquo; or as it had become shortened,
&ldquo;Haro.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now Osmond knew that those whose
affection had been won by the uprightness of Rollo, were
gathering to protect his helpless grandchild.</p>
<p>The cry was likewise heard by the little garrison in the
turret chamber, bringing hope and joy.&nbsp; Richard thought
himself already rescued, and springing from Fru Astrida, danced
about in ecstasy, only longing to see the faithful Normans, whose
voices he heard ringing out again and again, in calls for their
little Duke, and outcries against the Franks.&nbsp; The windows
were, however, so high, that nothing could be seen from them but
the sky; and, like Richard, the old Baron de Centeville was
almost beside himself with anxiety to know what force was
gathered together, and what measures were being taken.&nbsp; He
opened the door, called to his son, and asked if he could tell
what was passing, but Osmond knew as little&mdash;he could see
nothing but the black, cobwebbed, dusty steps winding above his
head, while the clamours outside, waxing fiercer and louder,
drowned all the sounds which might otherwise have come up to him
from the French within the Castle.&nbsp; At last, however, Osmond
called out to his father, in Norse, &ldquo;There is a Frank Baron
come to entreat, and this time very humbly, that the Duke may
come to the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; replied Sir Eric, &ldquo;that save
with consent of the council of Normandy, the child leaves not my
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; called back Osmond, after a moment,
&ldquo;that you shall guard him yourself, with as many as you
choose to bring with you.&nbsp; He declares on the faith of a
free Baron, that the King has no thought of ill&mdash;he wants to
show him to the Rouennais without, who are calling for him, and
threaten to tear down the tower rather than not see their little
Duke.&nbsp; Shall I bid him send a hostage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer him,&rdquo; returned the Baron, &ldquo;that the
Duke leaves not this chamber unless a pledge is put into our
hands for his safety.&nbsp; There was an oily-tongued Count, who
sat next the King at supper&mdash;let him come hither, and then
perchance I may trust the Duke among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond gave the desired reply, which was carried to the
King.&nbsp; Meantime the uproar outside grew louder than ever,
and there were new sounds, a horn was winded, and there was a
shout of &ldquo;<i>Dieu aide</i>!&rdquo; the Norman war-cry,
joined with &ldquo;Notre Dame de Harcourt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there!&rdquo; cried Sir Eric, with a long
breath, as if relieved of half his anxieties, &ldquo;the boy has
sped well.&nbsp; Bernard is here at last!&nbsp; Now his head and
hand are there, I doubt no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the Count,&rdquo; said Osmond, opening the
door, and admitting a stout, burly man, who seemed sorely out of
breath with the ascent of the steep, broken stair, and very
little pleased to find himself in such a situation.&nbsp; The
Baron de Centeville augured well from the speed with which he had
been sent, thinking it proved great perplexity and distress on
the part of Louis.&nbsp; Without waiting to hear his hostage
speak, he pointed to a chest on which he had been sitting, and
bade two of his men-at-arms stand on each side of the Count,
saying at the same time to Fru Astrida, &ldquo;Now, mother, if
aught of evil befalls the child, you know your part.&nbsp; Come,
Lord Richard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard moved forward.&nbsp; Sir Eric held his hand.&nbsp;
Osmond kept close behind him, and with as many of the men-at-arms
as could be spared from guarding Fru Astrida and her hostage, he
descended the stairs, not by any means sorry to go, for he was
weary of being besieged in that turret chamber, whence he could
see nothing, and with those friendly cries in his ears, he could
not be afraid.</p>
<p>He was conducted to the large council-room which was above the
hall.&nbsp; There, the King was walking up and down anxiously,
looking paler than his wont, and no wonder, for the uproar
sounded tremendous there&mdash;and now and then a stone dashed
against the sides of the deep window.</p>
<p>Nearly at the same moment as Richard entered by one door,
Count Bernard de Harcourt came in from the other, and there was a
slight lull in the tumult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means this, my Lords?&rdquo; exclaimed the
King.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here am I come in all good will, in memory of
my warm friendship with Duke William, to take on me the care of
his orphan, and hold council with you for avenging his death, and
is this the greeting you afford me?&nbsp; You steal away the
child, and stir up the rascaille of Rouen against me.&nbsp; Is
this the reception for your King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir King,&rdquo; replied Bernard, &ldquo;what your
intentions may be, I know not.&nbsp; All I do know is, that the
burghers of Rouen are fiercely incensed against you&mdash;so much
so, that they were almost ready to tear me to pieces for being
absent at this juncture.&nbsp; They say that you are keeping the
child prisoner in his own Castle and that they will have him
restored if they tear it down to the foundations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a true man, a loyal man&mdash;you understand my
good intentions,&rdquo; said Louis, trembling, for the Normans
were extremely dreaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not bring the
shame of rebellion on your town and people.&nbsp; Advise
me&mdash;I will do just as you counsel me&mdash;how shall I
appease them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the child, lead him to the window, swear that you
mean him no evil, that you will not take him from us,&rdquo; said
Bernard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Swear it on the faith of a King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a King&mdash;as a Christian, it is true!&rdquo; said
Louis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, my boy!&nbsp; Wherefore shrink from
me?&nbsp; What have I done, that you should fear me?&nbsp; You
have been listening to evil tales of me, my child.&nbsp; Come
hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a sign from the Count de Harcourt, Sir Eric led Richard
forward, and put his hand into the King&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Louis took
him to the window, lifted him upon the sill, and stood there with
his arm round him, upon which the shout, &ldquo;Long live
Richard, our little Duke!&rdquo; arose again.&nbsp; Meantime, the
two Centevilles looked in wonder at the old Harcourt, who shook
his head and muttered in his own tongue, &ldquo;I will do all I
may, but our force is small, and the King has the best of
it.&nbsp; We must not yet bring a war on ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! he is going to speak,&rdquo; said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair Sirs!&mdash;excellent burgesses!&rdquo; began the
King, as the cries lulled a little. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I
rejoice to see the love ye bear to our young Prince!&nbsp; I
would all my subjects were equally loyal!&nbsp; But wherefore
dread me, as if I were come to injure him?&nbsp; I, who came but
to take counsel how to avenge the death of his father, who
brought me back from England when I was a friendless exile.&nbsp;
Know ye not how deep is the debt of gratitude I owe to Duke
William?&nbsp; He it was who made me King&mdash;it was he who
gained me the love of the King of Germany; he stood godfather for
my son&mdash;to him I owe all my wealth and state, and all my
care is to render guerdon for it to his child, since, alas!&nbsp;
I may not to himself.&nbsp; Duke William rests in his bloody
grave!&nbsp; It is for me to call his murderers to account, and
to cherish his son, even as mine own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Louis tenderly embraced the little boy, and the
Rouennais below broke out into another cry, in which &ldquo;Long
live King Louis,&rdquo; was joined with &ldquo;Long live
Richard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not let the child go?&rdquo; said Eric,
meanwhile, to Harcourt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without provision for his safety, but we are not
fit for war as yet, and to let him go is the only means of
warding it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric groaned and shook his head; but the Count de
Harcourt&rsquo;s judgment was of such weight with him, that he
never dreamt of disputing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me here,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;all that
you deem most holy, and you shall see me pledge myself to be your
Duke&rsquo;s most faithful friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some delay, during which the Norman Nobles had time
for further counsel together, and Richard looked wistfully at
them, wondering what was to happen to him, and wishing he could
venture to ask for Alberic.</p>
<p>Several of the Clergy of the Cathedral presently appeared in
procession, bringing with them the book of the Gospels on which
Richard had taken his installation oath, with others of the
sacred treasures of the Church, preserved in gold cases.&nbsp;
The Priests were followed by a few of the Norman Knights and
Nobles, some of the burgesses of Rouen, and, to Richard&rsquo;s
great joy, by Alberic de Mont&eacute;mar himself.&nbsp; The two
boys stood looking eagerly at each other, while preparation was
made for the ceremony of the King&rsquo;s oath.</p>
<p>The stone table in the middle of the room was cleared, and
arranged so as in some degree to resemble the Altar in the
Cathedral; then the Count de Harcourt, standing before it, and
holding the King&rsquo;s hand, demanded of him whether he would
undertake to be the friend, protector, and good Lord of Richard,
Duke of Normandy, guarding him from all his enemies, and ever
seeking his welfare.&nbsp; Louis, with his hand on the Gospels,
&ldquo;swore that so he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; returned Bernard the Dane, solemnly,
&ldquo;and as thou keepest that oath to the fatherless child, so
may the Lord do unto thine house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then followed the ceremony, which had been interrupted the
night before, of the homage and oath of allegiance which Richard
owed to the King, and, on the other hand, the King&rsquo;s formal
reception of him as a vassal, holding, under him, the two
dukedoms of Normandy and Brittany.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said
the King, raising him in his arms and kissing him, &ldquo;no
dearer vassal do I hold in all my realm than this fair child, son
of my murdered friend and benefactor&mdash;precious to me as my
own children, as so on my Queen and I hope to testify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard did not much like all this embracing; but he was sure
the King really meant him no ill, and he wondered at all the
distrust the Centevilles had shown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, brave Normans,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;be ye
ready speedily, for an onset on the traitor Fleming.&nbsp; The
cause of my ward is my own cause.&nbsp; Soon shall the trumpet be
sounded, the ban and arri&egrave;re ban of the realm be called
forth, and Arnulf, in the flames of his cities, and the blood of
his vassals, shall learn to rue the day when his foot trod the
Isle of Pecquigny!&nbsp; How many Normans can you bring to the
muster, Sir Count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say, within a few hundreds of lances,&rdquo;
replied the old Dane, cautiously; &ldquo;it depends on the
numbers that may be engaged in the Italian war with the Saracens,
but of this be sure, Sir King, that every man in Normandy and
Brittany who can draw a sword or bend a bow, will stand forth in
the cause of our little Duke; ay, and that his blessed
father&rsquo;s memory is held so dear in our northern home, that
it needs but a message to King Harold Blue-tooth to bring a fleet
of long keels into the Seine, with stout Danes enough to carry
fire and sword, not merely through Flanders, but through all
France.&nbsp; We of the North are not apt to forget old
friendships and favours, Sir King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know the Norman faith of old,&rdquo;
returned Louis, uneasily, &ldquo;but we should scarcely need such
wild allies as you propose; the Count of Paris, and Hubert of
Senlis may be reckoned on, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No truer friend to Normandy than gallant and wise old
Hugh the White!&rdquo; said Bernard, &ldquo;and as to Senlis, he
is uncle to the boy, and doubly bound to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rejoice to see your confidence,&rdquo; said
Louis.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall soon hear from me.&nbsp; In the
meantime I must return to gather my force together, and summon my
great vassals, and I will, with your leave, brave Normans, take
with me my dear young ward.&nbsp; His presence will plead better
in his cause than the finest words; moreover, he will grow up in
love and friendship with my two boys, and shall be nurtured with
them in all good learning and chivalry, nor shall he ever be
reminded that he is an orphan while under the care of Queen
Gerberge and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the child come to me, so please you, my Lord the
King,&rdquo; answered Harcourt, bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must hold
some converse with him, ere I can reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go then, Richard,&rdquo; said Louis, &ldquo;go to your
trusty vassal&mdash;happy are you in possessing such a friend; I
hope you know his value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here then, young Sir,&rdquo; said the Count, in his
native tongue, when Richard had crossed from the King&rsquo;s
side, and stood beside him, &ldquo;what say you to this
proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King is very kind,&rdquo; said Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sure he is kind; but I do not like to go from Rouen,
or from Dame Astrida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Dane, stooping down
and speaking low.&nbsp; &ldquo;The King is resolved to have you
away; he has with him the best of his Franks, and has so taken us
at unawares, that though I might yet rescue you from his hands,
it would not be without a fierce struggle, wherein you might be
harmed, and this castle and town certainly burnt, and wrested
from us.&nbsp; A few weeks or months, and we shall have time to
draw our force together, so that Normandy need fear no man, and
for that time you must tarry with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I&mdash;and all alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not alone, not without the most trusty guardian
that can be found for you.&nbsp; Friend Eric, what say
you?&rdquo; and he laid his hand on the old Baron&rsquo;s
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet, I know not; true thou art, as a
Norwegian mountain, but I doubt me if thy brains are not too dull
to see through the French wiles and disguises, sharp as thou
didst show thyself last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Osmond, not I,&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He knows their mincing tongue better than I.&nbsp; He were
the best to go with the poor child, if go he must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bethink you, Eric,&rdquo; said the Count, in an
undertone, &ldquo;Osmond is the only hope of your good old
house&mdash;if there is foul play, the guardian will be the first
to suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you think fit to peril the only hope of all
Normandy, I am not the man to hold back my son where he may aid
him,&rdquo; said old Eric, sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor child
will be lonely and uncared-for there, and it were hard he should
not have one faithful comrade and friend with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Bernard: &ldquo;young as he is,
I had rather trust Osmond with the child than any one else, for
he is ready of counsel, and quick of hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and a pretty pass it is come to,&rdquo; muttered
old Centeville, &ldquo;that we, whose business it is to guard the
boy, should send him where you scarcely like to trust my
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernard paid no further attention to him, but, coming forward,
required another oath from the King, that Richard should be as
safe and free at his court as at Rouen, and that on no pretence
whatsoever should he be taken from under the immediate care of
his Esquire, Osmond Fitz Eric, heir of Centeville.</p>
<p>After this, the King was impatient to depart, and all was
preparation.&nbsp; Bernard called Osmond aside to give full
instructions on his conduct, and the means of communicating with
Normandy, and Richard was taking leave of Fru Astrida, who had
now descended from her turret, bringing her hostage with
her.&nbsp; She wept much over her little Duke, praying that he
might safely be restored to Normandy, even though she might not
live to see it; she exhorted him not to forget the good and holy
learning in which he had been brought up, to rule his temper,
and, above all, to say his prayers constantly, never leaving out
one, as the beads of his rosary reminded him of their
order.&nbsp; As to her own grandson, anxiety for him seemed
almost lost in her fears for Richard, and the chief things she
said to him, when he came to take leave of her, were directions
as to the care he was to take of the child, telling him the
honour he now received was one which would make his name forever
esteemed if he did but fulfil his trust, the most precious that
Norman had ever yet received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, grandmother, to the very best of my
power,&rdquo; said Osmond; &ldquo;I may die in his cause, but
never will I be faithless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alberic!&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;are you glad to be
going back to Mont&eacute;mar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my Lord,&rdquo; answered Alberic, sturdily,
&ldquo;as glad as you will be to come back to Rouen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall send for you directly, Alberic, for I
shall never love the Princes Carloman and Lothaire half as well
as you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord the King is waiting for the Duke,&rdquo; said a
Frenchman, coming forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell then, Fru Astrida.&nbsp; Do not weep.&nbsp; I
shall soon come back.&nbsp; Farewell, Alberic.&nbsp; Take the
bar-tailed falcon back to Mont&eacute;mar, and keep him for my
sake.&nbsp; Farewell, Sir Eric&mdash;Farewell, Count
Bernard.&nbsp; When the Normans come to conquer Arnulf you will
lead them.&nbsp; O dear, dear Fru Astrida, farewell
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, my own darling.&nbsp; The blessing of Heaven
go with you, and bring you safe home!&nbsp; Farewell,
Osmond.&nbsp; Heaven guard you and strengthen you to be his
shield and his defence!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>Away from the tall narrow gateway of Rollo&rsquo;s Tower, with
the cluster of friendly, sorrowful faces looking forth from it,
away from the booth-like shops of Rouen, and the stout burghers
shouting with all the power of their lungs, &ldquo;Long live Duke
Richard!&nbsp; Long live King Louis!&nbsp; Death to the
Fleming!&rdquo;&mdash;away from the broad Seine&mdash;away from
home and friends, rode the young Duke of Normandy, by the side of
the palfrey of the King of France.</p>
<p>The King took much notice of him, kept him by his side, talked
to him, admired the beautiful cattle grazing in security in the
green pastures, and, as he looked at the rich dark brown earth of
the fields, the Castles towering above the woods, the Convents
looking like great farms, the many villages round the rude
Churches, and the numerous population who came out to gaze at the
party, and repeat the cry of &ldquo;Long live the King!&nbsp;
Blessings on the little Duke!&rdquo; he told Richard, again and
again, that his was the most goodly duchy in France and Germany
to boot.</p>
<p>When they crossed the Epte, the King would have Richard in the
same boat with him, and sitting close to Louis, and talking
eagerly about falcons and hounds, the little Duke passed the
boundary of his own dukedom.</p>
<p>The country beyond was not like Normandy.&nbsp; First they
came to a great forest, which seemed to have no path through
it.&nbsp; The King ordered that one of the men, who had rowed
them across, should be made to serve as guide, and two of the
men-at-arms took him between them, and forced him to lead the
way, while others, with their swords and battle-axes, cut down
and cleared away the tangled branches and briars that nearly
choked the path.&nbsp; All the time, every one was sharply on the
look-out for robbers, and the weapons were all held ready for use
at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; On getting beyond the forest a
Castle rose before them, and, though it was not yet late in the
day, they resolved to rest there, as a marsh lay not far before
them, which it would not have been safe to traverse in the
evening twilight.</p>
<p>The Baron of the Castle received them with great respect to
the King, but without paying much attention to the Duke of
Normandy, and Richard did not find the second place left for him
at the board.&nbsp; He coloured violently, and looked first at
the King, and then at Osmond, but Osmond held up his finger in
warning; he remembered how he had lost his temper before, and
what had come of it, and resolved to try to bear it better; and
just then the Baron&rsquo;s daughter, a gentle-looking maiden of
fifteen or sixteen, came and spoke to him, and entertained him so
well, that he did not think much more of his offended
dignity.&mdash;When they set off on their journey again, the
Baron and several of his followers came with them to show the
only safe way across the morass, and a very slippery,
treacherous, quaking road it was, where the horses&rsquo; feet
left pools of water wherever they trod.&nbsp; The King and the
Baron rode together, and the other French Nobles closed round
them; Richard was left quite in the background, and though the
French men-at-arms took care not to lose sight of him, no one
offered him any assistance, excepting Osmond, who, giving his own
horse to Sybald, one of the two Norman grooms who accompanied
him, led Richard&rsquo;s horse by the bridle along the whole
distance of the marshy path, a business that could scarcely have
been pleasant, as Osmond wore his heavy hauberk, and his pointed,
iron-guarded boots sunk deep at every step into the bog.&nbsp; He
spoke little, but seemed to be taking good heed of every stump of
willow or stepping-stone that might serve as a note of
remembrance of the path.</p>
<p>At the other end of the morass began a long tract of
dreary-looking, heathy waste, without a sign of life.&nbsp; The
Baron took leave of the King, only sending three men-at-arms, to
show him the way to a monastery, which was to be the next
halting-place.&nbsp; He sent three, because it was not safe for
one, even fully armed, to ride alone, for fear of the attacks of
the followers of a certain marauding Baron, who was at deadly
feud with him, and made all that border a most perilous
region.&nbsp; Richard might well observe that he did not like the
Vexin half as well as Normandy, and that the people ought to
learn Fru Astrida&rsquo;s story of the golden bracelets, which,
in his grandfather&rsquo;s time, had hung untouched for a year,
in a tree in a forest.</p>
<p>It was pretty much the same through the whole journey, waste
lands, marshes, and forests alternated.&nbsp; The Castles stood
on high mounds frowning on the country round, and villages were
clustered round them, where the people either fled away, driving
off their cattle with them at the first sight of an armed band,
or else, if they remained, proved to be thin, wretched-looking
creatures, with wasted limbs, aguish faces, and often iron
collars round their necks.&nbsp; Wherever there was anything of
more prosperous appearance, such as a few cornfields, vineyards
on the slopes of the hills, fat cattle, and peasantry looking
healthy and secure, there was sure to be seen a range of long low
stone buildings, surmounted with crosses, with a short square
Church tower rising in the midst, and interspersed with gnarled
hoary old apple-trees, or with gardens of pot-herbs spreading
before them to the meadows.&nbsp; If, instead of two or three
men-at-arms from a Castle, or of some trembling serf pressed into
the service, and beaten, threatened, and watched to prevent
treachery, the King asked for a guide at a Convent, some lay
brother would take his staff; or else mount an ass, and proceed
in perfect confidence and security as to his return homewards,
sure that his poverty and his sacred character would alike
protect him from any outrage from the most lawless marauder of
the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Thus they travelled until they reached the royal Castle of
Laon, where the Fleur-de-Lys standard on the battlements
announced the presence of Gerberge, Queen of France, and her two
sons.&nbsp; The King rode first into the court with his Nobles,
and before Richard could follow him through the narrow arched
gateway, he had dismounted, entered the Castle, and was out of
sight.&nbsp; Osmond held the Duke&rsquo;s stirrup, and followed
him up the steps which led to the Castle Hall.&nbsp; It was full
of people, but no one made way, and Richard, holding his
Squire&rsquo;s hand, looked up in his face, inquiring and
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Seneschal,&rdquo; said Osmond, seeing a broad
portly old man, with grey hair and a golden chain, &ldquo;this is
the Duke of Normandy&mdash;I pray you conduct him to the
King&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard had no longer any cause to complain of neglect, for
the Seneschal instantly made him a very low bow, and calling
&ldquo;Place&mdash;place for the high and mighty Prince, my Lord
Duke of Normandy!&rdquo; ushered him up to the dais or raised
part of the floor, where the King and Queen stood together
talking.&nbsp; The Queen looked round, as Richard was announced,
and he saw her face, which was sallow, and with a sharp sour
expression that did not please him, and he backed and looked
reluctant, while Osmond, with a warning hand pressed on his
shoulder, was trying to remind him that he ought to go forward,
kneel on one knee, and kiss her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; said the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing secure!&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;but
what makes that northern giant keep close to his
heels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis answered something in a low voice, and, in the meantime,
Osmond tried in a whisper to induce his young Lord to go forward
and perform his obeisance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I will not,&rdquo; said Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She looks cross, and I do not like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily he spoke his own language; but his look and air
expressed a good deal of what he said, and Gerberge looked all
the more unattractive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thorough little Norwegian bear,&rdquo; said the King;
&ldquo;fierce and unruly as the rest.&nbsp; Come, and perform
your courtesy&mdash;do you forget where you are?&rdquo; he added,
sternly.</p>
<p>Richard bowed, partly because Osmond forced down his shoulder;
but he thought of old Rollo and Charles the Simple, and his proud
heart resolved that he would never kiss the hand of that
sour-looking Queen.&nbsp; It was a determination made in pride
and defiance, and he suffered for it afterwards; but no more
passed now, for the Queen only saw in his behaviour that of an
unmannerly young Northman: and though she disliked and despised
him, she did not care enough about his courtesy to insist on its
being paid.&nbsp; She sat down, and so did the King, and they
went on talking; the King probably telling her his adventures at
Rouen, while Richard stood on the step of the dais, swelling with
sullen pride.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of an hour had passed in this manner when the
servants came to set the table for supper, and Richard, in spite
of his indignant looks, was forced to stand aside.&nbsp; He
wondered that all this time he had not seen the two Princes,
thinking how strange he should have thought it, to let his own
dear father be in the house so long without coming to welcome
him.&nbsp; At last, just as the supper had been served up, a side
door opened, and the Seneschal called, &ldquo;Place for the high
and mighty Princes, my Lord Lothaire and my Lord Carloman!&rdquo;
and in walked two boys, one about the same age as Richard, the
other rather less than a year younger.&nbsp; They were both thin,
pale, sharp-featured children, and Richard drew himself up to his
full height, with great satisfaction at being so much taller than
Lothaire.</p>
<p>They came up ceremoniously to their father and kissed his
hand, while he kissed their foreheads, and then said to them,
&ldquo;There is a new play-fellow for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the little Northman?&rdquo; said Carloman,
turning to stare at Richard with a look of curiosity, while
Richard in his turn felt considerably affronted that a boy so
much less than himself should call him little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Queen; &ldquo;your father has
brought him home with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carloman stepped forward, shyly holding out his hand to the
stranger, but his brother pushed him rudely aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am the eldest; it is my business to be first.&nbsp; So, young
Northman, you are come here for us to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard was too much amazed at being spoken to in this
imperious way to make any answer.&nbsp; He was completely taken
by surprise, and only opened his great blue eyes to their utmost
extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! why don&rsquo;t you answer?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
hear?&nbsp; Can you speak only your own heathen tongue?&rdquo;
continued Lothaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Norman is no heathen tongue!&rdquo; said Richard,
at once breaking silence in a loud voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are as
good Christians as you are&mdash;ay, and better too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! my Lord!&rdquo; said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Sir Duke,&rdquo; again interfered the King,
in an angry tone, &ldquo;are you brawling already?&nbsp; Time,
indeed, I should take you from your own savage court.&nbsp; Sir
Squire, look to it, that you keep your charge in better rule, or
I shall send him instantly to bed, supperless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord, my Lord,&rdquo; whispered Osmond, &ldquo;see
you not that you are bringing discredit on all of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be courteous enough, if they would be courteous
to me,&rdquo; returned Richard, gazing with eyes full of defiance
at Lothaire, who, returning an angry look, had nevertheless
shrunk back to his mother.&nbsp; She meanwhile was saying,
&ldquo;So strong, so rough, the young savage is, he will surely
harm our poor boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said Louis; &ldquo;he shall be
watched.&nbsp; And,&rdquo; he added in a lower tone, &ldquo;for
the present, at least, we must keep up appearances.&nbsp; Hubert
of Senlis, and Hugh of Paris, have their eyes on us, and were the
boy to be missed, the grim old Harcourt would have all the
pirates of his land on us in the twinkling of an eye.&nbsp; We
have him, and there we must rest content for the present.&nbsp;
Now to supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At supper, Richard sat next little Carloman, who peeped at him
every now and then from under his eyelashes, as if he was afraid
of him; and presently, when there was a good deal of talking
going on, so that his voice could not be heard, half whispered,
in a very grave tone, &ldquo;Do you like salt beef or
fresh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like fresh,&rdquo; answered Richard, with equal
gravity, &ldquo;only we eat salt all the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another silence, and then Carloman, with the same
solemnity, asked, &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be nine on the eve of St. Boniface.&nbsp; How
old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight.&nbsp; I was eight at Martinmas, and Lothaire was
nine three days since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another silence; then, as Osmond waited on Richard, Carloman
returned to the charge, &ldquo;Is that your Squire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is Osmond de Centeville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How tall he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Normans are taller than you French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so to Lothaire, or you will make him
angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;&rdquo; and Carloman sunk his
voice&mdash;&ldquo;there are some things which Lothaire will not
hear said.&nbsp; Do not make him cross, or he will make my mother
displeased with you.&nbsp; She caused Thierry de Lincourt to be
scourged, because his ball hit Lothaire&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She cannot scourge me&mdash;I am a free Duke,&rdquo;
said Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why?&nbsp; Did he do it on
purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was Lothaire hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! you must say Prince Lothaire.&nbsp; No; it was
quite a soft ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; again asked Richard&mdash;&ldquo;why was he
scourged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, because he hit Lothaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but did he not laugh, and say it was
nothing?&nbsp; Alberic quite knocked me down with a great
snowball the other day, and Sir Eric laughed, and said I must
stand firmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you make snowballs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do!&nbsp; Do not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! the snow is so cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you are but a little boy,&rdquo; said Richard, in a
superior manner.&nbsp; Carloman asked how it was done; and
Richard gave an animated description of the snowballing, a
fortnight ago, at Rouen, when Osmond and some of the other young
men built a snow fortress, and defended it against Richard,
Alberic, and the other Squires.&nbsp; Carloman listened with
delight, and declared that next time it snowed, they would have a
snow castle; and thus, by the time supper was over, the two
little boys were very good friends.</p>
<p>Bedtime came not long after supper.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s was
a smaller room than he had been used to at Rouen; but it amazed
him exceedingly when he first went into it: he stood gazing in
wonder, because, as he said, &ldquo;It was as if he had been in a
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, truly!&rdquo; said Osmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;No wonder
these poor creatures of French cannot stand before a Norman
lance, if they cannot sleep without glass to their windows.&nbsp;
Well! what would my father say to this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see! see, Osmond! they have put hangings up all
round the walls, just like our Lady&rsquo;s church on a great
feast-day.&nbsp; They treat us just as if we were the holy
saints; and here are fresh rushes strewn about the floor,
too.&nbsp; This must be a mistake&mdash;it must be an oratory,
instead of my chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my Lord; here is our gear, which I bade Sybald
and Henry see bestowed in our chamber.&nbsp; Well, these Franks
are come to a pass, indeed!&nbsp; My grandmother will never
believe what we shall have to tell her.&nbsp; Glass windows and
hangings to sleeping chambers! I do not like it I am sure we
shall never be able to sleep, closed up from the free air of
heaven in this way: I shall be always waking, and fancying I am
in the chapel at home, hearing Father Lucas chanting his
matins.&nbsp; Besides, my father would blame me for letting you
be made as tender as a Frank.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have out this
precious window, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luxurious as the young Norman thought the King, the glazing of
Laon was not permanent.&nbsp; It consisted of casements, which
could be put up or removed at pleasure; for, as the court
possessed only one set of glass windows, they were taken down,
and carried from place to place, as often as Louis removed from
Rheims to Soissons, Laon, or any other of his royal castles; so
that Osmond did not find much difficulty in displacing them, and
letting in the sharp, cold, wintry breeze.&nbsp; The next thing
he did was to give his young Lord a lecture on his want of
courtesy, telling him that &ldquo;no wonder the Franks thought he
had no more culture than a Viking (or pirate), fresh caught from
Norway.&nbsp; A fine notion he was giving them of the training he
had at Centeville, if he could not even show common civility to
the Queen&mdash;a lady!&nbsp; Was that the way Alberic had
behaved when he came to Rouen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fru Astrida did not make sour faces at him, nor call
him a young savage,&rdquo; replied Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and he gave her no reason to do so; he knew that
the first teaching of a young Knight is to be courteous to
ladies&mdash;never mind whether fair and young, or old and foul
of favour.&nbsp; Till you learn and note that, Lord Richard, you
will never be worthy of your golden spurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the King told me she would treat me as a
mother,&rdquo; exclaimed Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think the
King speaks the truth, Osmond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we shall see by his deeds,&rdquo; said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very kind while we were in Normandy.&nbsp; I
loved him so much better than the Count de Harcourt; but now I
think that the Count is best!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you, Osmond,
I will never call him grim old Bernard again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had best not, sir, for you will never have a more
true-hearted vassal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish we were back in Normandy, with Fru Astrida
and Alberic.&nbsp; I cannot bear that Lothaire.&nbsp; He is
proud, and unknightly, and cruel.&nbsp; I am sure he is, and I
will never love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, my Lord!&mdash;beware of speaking so loud.&nbsp;
You are not in your own Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Carloman is a chicken-heart,&rdquo; continued
Richard, unheeding.&nbsp; &ldquo;He does not like to touch snow,
and he cannot even slide on the ice, and he is afraid to go near
that great dog&mdash;that beautiful wolf-hound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very little,&rdquo; said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I was not as cowardly at his age, now was I,
Osmond?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Lord Richard, I cannot let you wait to remember
everything; tell your beads and pray that we may be brought safe
back to Rouen; and that you may not forget all the good that
Father Lucas and holy Abbot Martin have laboured to teach
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Richard told the beads of his rosary&mdash;black polished
wood, with amber at certain spaces&mdash;he repeated a prayer
with every bead, and Osmond did the same; then the little Duke
put himself into a narrow crib of richly carved walnut; while
Osmond, having stuck his dagger so as to form an additional bolt
to secure the door, and examined the hangings that no secret
entrance might be concealed behind them, gathered a heap of
rushes together, and lay down on them, wrapped in his mantle,
across the doorway.&nbsp; The Duke was soon asleep; but the
Squire lay long awake, musing on the possible dangers that
surrounded his charge, and on the best way of guarding against
them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>Osmond de Centeville was soon convinced that no immediate
peril threatened his young Duke at the Court of Laon.&nbsp; Louis
seemed to intend to fulfil his oaths to the Normans by allowing
the child to be the companion of his own sons, and to be treated
in every respect as became his rank.&nbsp; Richard had his proper
place at table, and all due attendance; he learnt, rode, and
played with the Princes, and there was nothing to complain of,
excepting the coldness and inattention with which the King and
Queen treated him, by no means fulfilling the promise of being as
parents to their orphan ward.&nbsp; Gerberge, who had from the
first dreaded his superior strength and his roughness with her
puny boys, and who had been by no means won by his manners at
their first meeting, was especially distant and severe with him,
hardly ever speaking to him except with some rebuke, which, it
must be confessed, Richard often deserved.</p>
<p>As to the boys, his constant companions, Richard was on very
friendly terms with Carlo-man, a gentle, timid, weakly
child.&nbsp; Richard looked down upon him; but he was kind, as a
generous-tempered boy could not fail to be, to one younger and
weaker than himself.&nbsp; He was so much kinder than Lothaire,
that Carloman was fast growing very fond of him, and looked up to
his strength and courage as something noble and marvellous.</p>
<p>It was very different with Lothaire, the person from whom,
above all others, Richard would have most expected to meet with
affection, as his father&rsquo;s god-son, a relationship which in
those times was thought almost as near as kindred by blood.&nbsp;
Lothaire had been brought up by an indulgent mother, and by
courtiers who never ceased flattering him, as the heir to the
crown, and he had learnt to think that to give way to his
naturally imperious and violent disposition was the way to prove
his power and assert his rank.&nbsp; He had always had his own
way, and nothing had ever been done to check his faults; somewhat
weakly health had made him fretful and timid; and a latent
consciousness of this fearfulness made him all the more cruel,
sometimes because he was frightened, sometimes because he fancied
it manly.</p>
<p>He treated his little brother in a way which in these times
boys would call bullying; and, as no one ever dared to oppose the
King&rsquo;s eldest son, it was pretty much the same with every
one else, except now and then some dumb creature, and then all
Lothaire&rsquo;s cruelty was shown.&nbsp; When his horse kicked,
and ended by throwing him, he stood by, and caused it to be
beaten till the poor creature&rsquo;s back streamed with blood;
when his dog bit his hand in trying to seize the meat with which
he was teazing it, he insisted on having it killed, and it was
worse still when a falcon pecked one of his fingers.&nbsp; It
really hurt him a good deal, and, in a furious rage, he caused
two nails to be heated red hot in the fire, intending to have
them thrust into the poor bird&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not have it done!&rdquo; exclaimed Richard,
expecting to be obeyed as he was at home; but Lothaire only
laughed scornfully, saying, &ldquo;Do you think you are master
here, Sir pirate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not have it done!&rdquo; repeated Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shame on you, shame on you, for thinking of such an
unkingly deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on me! Do you know to whom you speak, master
savage?&rdquo; cried Lothaire, red with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who is the savage now!&rdquo; said
Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; to the servant who was
bringing the red-hot irons in a pair of tongs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold?&rdquo; exclaimed Lothaire.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one
commands here but I and my father.&nbsp; Go on
Charlot&mdash;where is the bird?&nbsp; Keep her fast,
Giles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Osmond.&nbsp; You I can command&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come away, my Lord,&rdquo; said Osmond, interrupting
Richard&rsquo;s order, before it was issued. &ldquo;We have no
right to interfere here, and cannot hinder it.&nbsp; Come away
from such a foul sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on you too, Osmond, to let such a deed be done
without hindering it!&rdquo; exclaimed Richard, breaking from
him, and rushing on the man who carried the hot irons.&nbsp; The
French servants were not very willing to exert their strength
against the Duke of Normandy, and Richard&rsquo;s onset, taking
the man by surprise, made him drop the tongs.&nbsp; Lothaire,
both afraid and enraged, caught them up as a weapon of defence,
and, hardly knowing what he did, struck full at Richard&rsquo;s
face with the hot iron.&nbsp; Happily it missed his eye, and the
heat had a little abated; but, as it touched his cheek, it burnt
him sufficiently to cause considerable pain.&nbsp; With a cry of
passion, he flew at Lothaire, shook him with all his might, and
ended by throwing him at his length on the pavement.&nbsp; But
this was the last of Richard&rsquo;s exploits, for he was at the
same moment captured by his Squire, and borne off, struggling and
kicking as if Osmond had been his greatest foe; but the young
Norman&rsquo;s arms were like iron round him; and he gave over
his resistance sooner, because at that moment a whirring flapping
sound was heard, and the poor hawk rose high, higher, over their
heads in ever lessening circles, far away from her enemies.&nbsp;
The servant who held her, had relaxed his grasp in the
consternation caused by Lothaire&rsquo;s fall, and she was
mounting up and up, spying, it might be, her way to her native
rocks in Iceland, with the yellow eyes which Richard had
saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe! safe!&rdquo; cried Richard, joyfully, ceasing his
struggles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, how glad I am!&nbsp; That young
villain should never have hurt her.&nbsp; Put me down, Osmond,
what are you doing with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saving you from your&mdash;no, I cannot call it
folly,&mdash;I would hardly have had you stand still to see
such&mdash;but let me see your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care now the hawk is
safe,&rdquo; said Richard, though he could hardly keep his lips
in order, and was obliged to wink very hard with his eyes to keep
the tears out, now that he had leisure to feel the smarting; but
it would have been far beneath a Northman to complain, and he
stood bearing it gallantly, and pinching his fingers tightly
together, while Osmond knelt down to examine the hurt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not much,&rdquo; said he, talking to himself,
&ldquo;half bruise, half burn&mdash;I wish my grandmother was
here&mdash;however, it can&rsquo;t last long!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
right, you bear it like a little Berserkar, and it is no bad
thing that you should have a scar to show, that they may not be
able to say you did <i>all</i> the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it always leave a mark?&rdquo; said Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am afraid they will call me Richard of the scarred
cheek, when we get back to Normandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, if they do&mdash;it will not be a mark to
be ashamed of, even if it does last, which I do not believe it
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I am so glad the gallant falcon is out of his
reach!&rdquo; replied Richard, in a somewhat quivering voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it smart much?&nbsp; Well, come and bathe it with
cold water&mdash;or shall I take you to one of the Queen&rsquo;s
women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;the water,&rdquo; said Richard, and to the
fountain in the court they went; but Osmond had only just begun
to splash the cheek with the half-frozen water, with a sort of
rough kindness, afraid at once of teaching the Duke to be
effeminate, and of not being as tender to him as Dame Astrida
would have wished, when a messenger came in haste from the King,
commanding the presence of the Duke of Normandy and his
Squire.</p>
<p>Lothaire was standing between his father and mother on their
throne-like seat, leaning against the Queen, who had her arm
round him; his face was red and glazed with tears, and he still
shook with subsiding sobs.&nbsp; It was evident he was just
recovering from a passionate crying fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this?&rdquo; began the King, as Richard
entered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What means this conduct, my Lord of
Normandy?&nbsp; Know you what you have done in striking the heir
of France?&nbsp; I might imprison you this instant in a dungeon
where you would never see the light of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Bernard de Harcourt would come and set me
free,&rdquo; fearlessly answered Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you bandy words with me, child? Ask Prince
Lothaire&rsquo;s pardon instantly, or you shall rue
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done nothing to ask his pardon for.&nbsp; It
would have been cruel and cowardly in me to let him put out the
poor hawk&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; said Richard, with a
Northman&rsquo;s stern contempt for pain, disdaining to mention
his own burnt cheek, which indeed the King might have seen
plainly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawk&rsquo;s eyes!&rdquo; repeated the King.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak the truth, Sir Duke; do not add slander to your
other faults.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p124b.jpg">
<img alt="False accusation" src="images/p124s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken the truth&mdash;I always speak it!&rdquo;
cried Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever says otherwise lies in his
throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond here hastily interfered, and desired permission to tell
the whole story.&nbsp; The hawk was a valuable bird, and
Louis&rsquo;s face darkened when he heard what Lothaire had
purposed, for the Prince had, in telling his own story, made it
appear that Richard had been the aggressor by insisting on
letting the falcon fly.&nbsp; Osmond finished by pointing to the
mark on Richard&rsquo;s cheek, so evidently a burn, as to be
proof that hot iron had played a part in the matter.&nbsp; The
King looked at one of his own Squires and asked his account, and
he with some hesitation could not but reply that it was as the
young Sieur de Centeville had said.&nbsp; Thereupon Louis angrily
reproved his own people for having assisted the Prince in trying
to injure the hawk, called for the chief falconer, rated him for
not better attending to his birds, and went forth with him to see
if the hawk could yet be recaptured, leaving the two boys neither
punished nor pardoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have escaped for this once,&rdquo; said
Gerberge, coldly, to Richard; &ldquo;you had better beware
another time.&nbsp; Come with me, my poor darling
Lothaire.&rdquo;&nbsp; She led her son away to her own
apartments, and the French Squires began to grumble to each other
complaints of the impossibility of pleasing their Lords, since,
if they contradicted Prince Lothaire, he was so spiteful that he
was sure to set the Queen against them, and that was far worse in
the end than the King&rsquo;s displeasure.&nbsp; Osmond, in the
meantime, took Richard to re-commence bathing his face, and
presently Carloman ran out to pity him, wonder at him for not
crying, and say he was glad the poor hawk had escaped.</p>
<p>The cheek continued inflamed and painful for some time, and
there was a deep scar long after the pain had ceased, but Richard
thought little of it after the first, and would have scorned to
bear ill-will to Lothaire for the injury.</p>
<p>Lothaire left off taunting Richard with his Norman accent, and
calling him a young Sea-king.&nbsp; He had felt his strength, and
was afraid of him; but he did not like him the better&mdash;he
never played with him willingly&mdash;scowled, and looked dark
and jealous, if his father, or if any of the great nobles took
the least notice of the little Duke, and whenever he was out of
hearing, talked against him with all his natural
spitefulness.</p>
<p>Richard liked Lothaire quite as little, contemning almost
equally his cowardly ways and his imperious disposition.&nbsp;
Since he had been Duke, Richard had been somewhat inclined to
grow imperious himself, though always kept under restraint by Fru
Astrida&rsquo;s good training, and Count Bernard&rsquo;s
authority, and his whole generous nature would have revolted
against treating Alberic, or indeed his meanest vassal, as
Lothaire used the unfortunate children who were his
playfellows.&nbsp; Perhaps this made him look on with great
horror at the tyranny which Lothaire exercised; at any rate he
learnt to abhor it more, and to make many resolutions against
ordering people about uncivilly when once he should be in
Normandy again.&nbsp; He often interfered to protect the poor
boys, and generally with success, for the Prince was afraid of
provoking such another shake as Richard had once given him, and
though he generally repaid himself on his victim in the end, he
yielded for the time.</p>
<p>Carloman, whom Richard often saved from his brother&rsquo;s
unkindness, clung closer and closer to him, went with him
everywhere, tried to do all he did, grew very fond of Osmond, and
liked nothing better than to sit by Richard in some wide
window-seat, in the evening, after supper, and listen to
Richard&rsquo;s version of some of Fru Astrida&rsquo;s favourite
tales, or hear the never-ending history of sports at Centeville,
or at Rollo&rsquo;s Tower, or settle what great things they would
both do when they were grown up, and Richard was ruling
Normandy&mdash;perhaps go to the Holy Land together, and
slaughter an unheard-of host of giants and dragons on the
way.&nbsp; In the meantime, however, poor Carloman gave small
promise of being able to perform great exploits, for he was very
small for his age and often ailing; soon tired, and never able to
bear much rough play.&nbsp; Richard, who had never had any reason
to learn to forbear, did not at first understand this, and made
Carloman cry several times with his roughness and violence, but
this always vexed him so much that he grew careful to avoid such
things for the future, and gradually learnt to treat his poor
little weakly friend with a gentleness and patience at which
Osmond used to marvel, and which he would hardly have been taught
in his prosperity at home.</p>
<p>Between Carloman and Osmond he was thus tolerably happy at
Laon, but he missed his own dear friends, and the loving
greetings of his vassals, and longed earnestly to be at Rouen,
asking Osmond almost every night when they should go back, to
which Osmond could only answer that he must pray that Heaven
would be pleased to bring them home safely.</p>
<p>Osmond, in the meantime, kept a vigilant watch for anything
that might seem to threaten danger to his Lord; but at present
there was no token of any evil being intended; the only point in
which Louis did not seem to be fulfilling his promises to the
Normans was, that no preparations were made for attacking the
Count of Flanders.</p>
<p>At Easter the court was visited by Hugh the White, the great
Count of Paris, the most powerful man in France, and who was only
prevented by his own loyalty and forbearance, from taking the
crown from the feeble and degenerate race of Charlemagne.&nbsp;
He had been a firm friend of William Longsword, and Osmond
remarked how, on his arrival, the King took care to bring Richard
forward, talk of him affectionately, and caress him almost as
much as he had done at Rouen.&nbsp; The Count himself was really
kind and affectionate to the little Duke; he kept him by his
side, and seemed to like to stroke down his long flaxen hair,
looking in his face with a grave mournful expression, as if
seeking for a likeness to his father.&nbsp; He soon asked about
the scar which the burn had left, and the King was obliged to
answer hastily, it was an accident, a disaster that had chanced
in a boyish quarrel.&nbsp; Louis, in fact, was uneasy, and
appeared to be watching the Count of Paris the whole time of his
visit, so as to prevent him from having any conversation in
private with the other great vassals assembled at the
court.&nbsp; Hugh did not seem to perceive this, and acted as if
he was entirely at his ease, but at the same time he watched his
opportunity.&nbsp; One evening, after supper, he came up to the
window where Richard and Carloman were, as usual, deep in story
telling; he sat down on the stone seat, and taking Richard on his
knee, he asked if he had any greetings for the Count de
Harcourt.</p>
<p>How Richard&rsquo;s face lighted up!&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are you going to
Normandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my boy, but it may be that I may have to meet
old Harcourt at the Elm of Gisors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I was but going with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could take you, but it would scarcely do for
me to steal the heir of Normandy.&nbsp; What shall I tell
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; whispered Richard, edging himself
close to the Count, and trying to reach his ear, &ldquo;tell him
that I am sorry, now, that I was sullen when he reproved
me.&nbsp; I know he was right.&nbsp; And, sir, if he brings with
him a certain huntsman with a long hooked nose, whose name is
Walter, <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a> tell him I am sorry I used to order him
about so unkindly.&nbsp; And tell him to bear my greetings to Fru
Astrida and Sir Eric, and to Alberic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell him how you have marked your
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;he would think me a
baby to care about such a thing as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Count asked how it happened, and Richard told the story,
for he felt as if he could tell the kind Count anything&mdash;it
was almost like that last evening that he had sat on his
father&rsquo;s knee.&nbsp; Hugh ended by putting his arm round
him, and saying, &ldquo;Well, my little Duke, I am as glad as you
are the gallant bird is safe&mdash;it will be a tale for my own
little Hugh and Eumacette <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a> at home&mdash;and
you must one day be friends with them as your father has been
with me.&nbsp; And now, do you think your Squire could come to my
chamber late this evening when the household is at
rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard undertook that Osmond should do so, and the Count,
setting him down again, returned to the dais.&nbsp; Osmond,
before going to the Count that evening, ordered Sybald to come
and guard the Duke&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; It was a long conference,
for Hugh had come to Laon chiefly for the purpose of seeing how
it went with his friend&rsquo;s son, and was anxious to know what
Osmond thought of the matter.&nbsp; They agreed that at present
there did not seem to be any evil intended, and that it rather
appeared as if Louis wished only to keep him as a hostage for the
tranquillity of the borders of Normandy; but Hugh advised that
Osmond should maintain a careful watch, and send intelligence to
him on the first token of mischief.</p>
<p>The next morning the Count of Paris quitted Laon, and
everything went on in the usual course till the feast of
Whitsuntide, when there was always a great display of splendour
at the French court.&nbsp; The crown vassals generally came to
pay their duty and go with the King to Church; and there was a
state banquet, at which the King and Queen wore their crowns, and
every one sat in great magnificence according to their rank.</p>
<p>The grand procession to Church was over.&nbsp; Richard had
walked with Carloman, the Prince richly dressed in blue,
embroidered with golden fleur-de-lys, and Richard in scarlet,
with a gold Cross on his breast; the beautiful service was over,
they had returned to the Castle, and there the Seneschal was
marshalling the goodly and noble company to the banquet, when
horses&rsquo; feet were heard at the gate announcing some fresh
arrival.&nbsp; The Seneschal went to receive the guests, and
presently was heard ushering in the noble Prince, Arnulf, Count
of Flanders.</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s face became pale&mdash;he turned from Carloman
by whose side he had been standing, and walked straight out of
the hall and up the stairs, closely followed by Osmond.&nbsp; In
a few minutes there was a knock at the door of his chamber, and a
French Knight stood there saying, &ldquo;Comes not the Duke to
the banquet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Osmond: &ldquo;he eats not with the
slayer of his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King will take it amiss; for the sake of the child
you had better beware,&rdquo; said the Frenchman, hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had better beware himself,&rdquo; exclaimed Osmond,
indignantly, &ldquo;how he brings the treacherous murderer of
William Longsword into the presence of a free-born Norman, unless
he would see him slain where he stands.&nbsp; Were it not for the
boy, I would challenge the traitor this instant to single
combat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can scarce blame you,&rdquo; said the Knight,
&ldquo;but you had best have a care how you tread.&nbsp;
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard had hardly time to express his indignation, and his
wishes that he was a man, before another message came through a
groom of Lothaire&rsquo;s train, that the Duke must fast, if he
would not consent to feast with the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Prince Lothaire,&rdquo; replied Richard,
&ldquo;that I am not such a glutton as he&mdash;I had rather fast
than be choked with eating with Arnulf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the rest of the day, Richard remained in his own chamber,
resolved not to run the risk of meeting with Arnulf.&nbsp; The
Squire remained with him, in this voluntary imprisonment, and
they occupied themselves, as best they could, with furbishing
Osmond&rsquo;s armour, and helping each other out in repeating
some of the Sagas.&nbsp; They once heard a great uproar in the
court, and both were very anxious to learn its cause, but they
did not know it till late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Carloman crept up to them&mdash;&ldquo;Here I am at
last!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, Richard, I have
brought you some bread, as you had no dinner: it was all I could
bring.&nbsp; I saved it under the table lest Lothaire should see
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard thanked Carloman with all his heart, and being very
hungry was glad to share the bread with Osmond.&nbsp; He asked
how long the wicked Count was going to stay, and rejoiced to hear
he was going away the next morning, and the King was going with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that great noise in the court?&rdquo; asked
Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely like to tell you,&rdquo; returned
Carloman.</p>
<p>Richard, however, begged to hear, and Carloman was obliged to
tell that the two Norman grooms, Sybald and Henry, had quarrelled
with the Flemings of Arnulf&rsquo;s train; there had been a fray,
which had ended in the death of three Flemings, a Frank, and of
Sybald himself&mdash;And where was Henry?&nbsp; Alas! there was
more ill news&mdash;the King had sentenced Henry to die, and he
had been hanged immediately.</p>
<p>Dark with anger and sorrow grew young Richard&rsquo;s face; he
had been fond of his two Norman attendants, he trusted to their
attachment, and he would have wept for their loss even if it had
happened in any other way; but now, when it had been caused by
their enmity to his father&rsquo;s foes, the Flemings,&mdash;when
one had fallen overwhelmed by numbers, and the other been
condemned hastily, cruelly, unjustly, it was too much, and he
almost choked with grief and indignation.&nbsp; Why had he not
been there, to claim Henry as his own vassal, and if he could not
save him, at least bid him farewell?&nbsp; Then he would have
broken out in angry threats, but he felt his own helplessness,
and was ashamed, and he could only shed tears of passionate
grief, refusing all Carloman&rsquo;s attempts to comfort
him.&nbsp; Osmond was even more concerned; he valued the two
Normans extremely for their courage and faithfulness, and had
relied on sending intelligence by their means to Rouen, in case
of need.&nbsp; It appeared to him as if the first opportunity had
been seized of removing these protectors from the little Duke,
and as if the designs, whatever they might be, which had been
formed against him, were about to take effect.&nbsp; He had
little doubt that his own turn would be the next; but he was
resolved to endure anything, rather than give the smallest
opportunity of removing him, to bear even insults with patience,
and to remember that in his care rested the sole hope of safety
for his charge.</p>
<p>That danger was fast gathering around them became more evident
every day, especially after the King and Arnulf had gone away
together.&nbsp; It was very hot weather, and Richard began to
weary after the broad cool river at Rouen, where he used to bathe
last summer; and one evening he persuaded his Squire to go down
with him to the Oise, which flowed along some meadow ground about
a quarter of a mile from the Castle; but they had hardly set
forth before three or four attendants came running after them,
with express orders from the Queen that they should return
immediately.&nbsp; They obeyed, and found her standing in the
Castle hall, looking greatly incensed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What means this?&rdquo; she asked, angrily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Knew you not that the King has left commands that the Duke
quits not the Castle in his absence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only going as far as the river&mdash;&rdquo;
began Richard, but Gerberge cut him short.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence,
child&mdash;I will hear no excuses.&nbsp; Perhaps you think,
Sieur de Centeville, that you may take liberties in the
King&rsquo;s absence, but I tell you that if you are found
without the walls again, it shall be at your peril; ay, and
his!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have those haughty eyes put out, if you
disobey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away, and Lothaire looked at them with his air of
gratified malice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will not lord it over your
betters much longer, young pirate!&rdquo; said he, as he followed
his mother, afraid to stay to meet the anger he might have
excited by the taunt he could not deny himself the pleasure of
making; but Richard, who, six months ago could not brook a slight
disappointment or opposition, had, in his present life of
restraint, danger, and vexation, learnt to curb the first
outbreak of temper, and to bear patiently instead of breaking out
into passion and threats, and now his only thought was of his
beloved Squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Osmond!&nbsp; Osmond!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;they shall not hurt you.&nbsp; I will never go out
again.&nbsp; I will never speak another hasty word.&nbsp; I will
never affront the Prince, if they will but leave you with
me!&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>It was a fine summer evening, and Richard and Carloman were
playing at ball on the steps of the Castle-gate, when a voice was
heard from beneath, begging for alms from the noble Princes in
the name of the blessed Virgin, and the two boys saw a pilgrim
standing at the gate, wrapt in a long robe of serge, with a staff
in his hand, surmounted by a Cross, a scrip at his girdle, and a
broad shady hat, which he had taken off, as he stood, making low
obeisances, and asking charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, holy pilgrim,&rdquo; said Carloman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is late, and you shall sup and rest here
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessings from Heaven light on you, noble
Prince,&rdquo; replied the pilgrim, and at that moment Richard
shouted joyfully, &ldquo;A Norman, a Norman! &rsquo;tis my own
dear speech!&nbsp; Oh, are you not from Normandy?&nbsp; Osmond,
Osmond! he comes from home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord! my own Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed the pilgrim,
and, kneeling on one knee at the foot of the steps, he kissed the
hand which his young Duke held out to him&mdash;&ldquo;This is
joy unlooked for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter!&mdash;Walter, the huntsman!&rdquo; cried
Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it you?&nbsp; Oh, how is Fru Astrida,
and all at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my Lord, and wearying to know how it is with
you&mdash;&rdquo; began Walter&mdash;but a very different tone
exclaimed from behind the pilgrim, &ldquo;What is all this?&nbsp;
Who is stopping my way?&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Richard would be King,
and more, would he?&nbsp; More insolence!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
Lothaire, returning with his attendants from the chase, in by no
means an amiable mood, for he had been disappointed of his
game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a Norman&mdash;a vassal of Richard&rsquo;s
own,&rdquo; said Carloman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Norman, is he?&nbsp; I thought we had got rid of the
robbers!&nbsp; We want no robbers here!&nbsp; Scourge him
soundly, Perron, and teach him how to stop my way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a pilgrim, my Lord,&rdquo; suggested one of the
followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care not; I&rsquo;ll have no Normans here, coming
spying in disguise.&nbsp; Scourge him, I say, dog that he
is!&nbsp; Away with him!&nbsp; A spy, a spy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Norman is scourged in my sight!&rdquo; said Richard,
darting forwards, and throwing himself between Walter and the
woodsman, who was preparing to obey Lothaire, just in time to
receive on his own bare neck the sharp, cutting leathern thong,
which raised a long red streak along its course.&nbsp; Lothaire
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord Duke!&nbsp; What have you done?&nbsp; Oh, leave
me&mdash;this befits you not!&rdquo; cried Walter, extremely
distressed; but Richard had caught hold of the whip, and called
out, &ldquo;Away, away! run! haste, haste!&rdquo; and the words
were repeated at once by Osmond, Carloman, and many of the
French, who, though afraid to disobey the Prince, were unwilling
to violate the sanctity of a pilgrim&rsquo;s person; and the
Norman, seeing there was no help for it, obeyed: the French made
way for him and he effected his escape; while Lothaire, after a
great deal of storming and raging, went up to his mother to
triumph in the cleverness with which he had detected a Norman spy
in disguise.</p>
<p>Lothaire was not far wrong; Walter had really come to satisfy
himself as to the safety of the little Duke, and try to gain an
interview with Osmond.&nbsp; In the latter purpose he failed,
though he lingered in the neighbourhood of Laon for several days;
for Osmond never left the Duke for an instant, and he was, as has
been shown, a close prisoner, in all but the name, within the
walls of the Castle.&nbsp; The pilgrim had, however, the
opportunity of picking up tidings which made him perceive the
true state of things: he learnt the deaths of Sybald and Henry,
the alliance between the King and Arnulf, and the restraint and
harshness with which the Duke was treated; and with this
intelligence he went in haste to Normandy.</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival, a three days&rsquo; fast was observed
throughout the dukedom, and in every church, from the Cathedral
of Bayeux to the smallest and rudest village shrine, crowds of
worshippers were kneeling, imploring, many of them with tears,
that God would look on them in His mercy, restore to them their
Prince, and deliver the child out of the hands of his
enemies.&nbsp; How earnest and sorrowful were the prayers offered
at Centeville may well be imagined; and at Mont&eacute;mar sur
Epte the anxiety was scarcely less.&nbsp; Indeed, from the time
the evil tidings arrived, Alberic grew so restless and unhappy,
and so anxious to do something, that at last his mother set out
with him on a pilgrimage to the Abbey of Jumi&egrave;ges, to pray
for the rescue of his dear little Duke.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Louis had sent notice to Laon that he should
return home in a week&rsquo;s time; and Richard rejoiced at the
prospect, for the King had always been less unkind to him than
the Queen, and he hoped to be released from his captivity within
the Castle.&nbsp; Just at this time he became very unwell; it
might have been only the effect of the life of unwonted
confinement which he had lately led that was beginning to tell on
his health; but, after being heavy and uncomfortable for a day or
two, without knowing what was the matter with him, he was one
night attacked with high fever.</p>
<p>Osmond was dreadfully alarmed, knowing nothing at all of the
treatment of illness, and, what was worse, fully persuaded that
the poor child had been poisoned, and therefore resolved not to
call any assistance; he hung over him all night, expecting each
moment to see him expire&mdash;ready to tear his hair with
despair and fury, and yet obliged to restrain himself to the
utmost quietness and gentleness, to soothe the suffering of the
sick child.</p>
<p>Through that night, Richard either tossed about on his narrow
bed, or, when his restlessness desired the change, sat, leaning
his aching head on Osmond&rsquo;s breast, too oppressed and
miserable to speak or think.&nbsp; When the day dawned on them,
and he was still too ill to leave the room, messengers were sent
for him, and Osmond could no longer conceal the fact of his
sickness, but parleyed at the door, keeping out every one he
could, and refusing all offers of attendance.&nbsp; He would not
even admit Carloman, though Richard, hearing his voice, begged to
see him; and when a proposal was sent from the Queen, that a
skilful old nurse should visit and prescribe for the patient, he
refused with all his might, and when he had shut the door, walked
up and down, muttering, &ldquo;Ay, ay, the witch! coming to
finish what she has begun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that day and the next, Richard continued very ill, and
Osmond waited on him very assiduously, never closing his eyes for
a moment, but constantly telling his beads whenever the boy did
not require his attendance.&nbsp; At last Richard fell asleep,
slept long and soundly for some hours, and waked much
better.&nbsp; Osmond was in a transport of joy: &ldquo;Thanks to
Heaven, they shall fail for this time and they shall never have
another chance!&nbsp; May Heaven be with us still!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Richard was too weak and weary to ask what he meant, and for the
next few days Osmond watched him with the utmost care.&nbsp; As
for food, now that Richard could eat again, Osmond would not hear
of his touching what was sent for him from the royal table, but
always went down himself to procure food in the kitchen, where he
said he had a friend among the cooks, who would, he thought,
scarcely poison him intentionally.&nbsp; When Richard was able to
cross the room, he insisted on his always fastening the door with
his dagger, and never opening to any summons but his own, not
even Prince Carloman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Richard wondered, but he was
obliged to obey; and he knew enough of the perils around him to
perceive the reasonableness of Osmond&rsquo;s caution.</p>
<p>Thus several days had passed, the King had returned, and
Richard was so much recovered, that he had become very anxious to
be allowed to go down stairs again, instead of remaining shut up
there; but still Osmond would not consent, though Richard had
done nothing all day but walk round the room, to show how strong
he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my Lord, guard the door&mdash;take care,&rdquo;
said Osmond; &ldquo;you have no loss to-day, for the King has
brought home Herluin of Montreuil, whom you would be almost as
loth to meet as the Fleming.&nbsp; And tell your beads while I am
gone, that the Saints may bring us out of our peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond was absent nearly half an hour, and, when he returned,
brought on his shoulders a huge bundle of straw.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is this for?&rdquo; exclaimed Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wanted my supper, and you have brought straw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your supper,&rdquo; said Osmond, throwing down
the straw, and producing a bag with some bread and meat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What should you say, my Lord, if we should sup in Normandy
to-morrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Normandy!&rdquo; cried Richard, springing up and
clapping his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;In Normandy!&nbsp; Oh, Osmond,
did you say in Normandy?&nbsp; Shall we, shall we really?&nbsp;
Oh, joy! joy!&nbsp; Is Count Bernard come?&nbsp; Will the King
let us go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush, sir!&nbsp; It must be our own doing; it
will all fail if you are not silent and prudent, and we shall be
undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do anything to get home again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat first,&rdquo; said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&nbsp; I will not be as
foolish as I was when you tried to get me safe out of
Rollo&rsquo;s tower.&nbsp; But I should like to wish Carloman
farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must not be,&rdquo; said Osmond; &ldquo;we should
not have time to escape, if they did not still believe you very
ill in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry not to wish Carloman good-bye,&rdquo;
repeated Richard; &ldquo;but we shall see Fru Astrida again, and
Sir Eric; and Alberic must come back!&nbsp; Oh, do let us
go!&nbsp; O Normandy, dear Normandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard could hardly eat for excitement, while Osmond hastily
made his arrangements, girding on his sword, and giving Richard
his dagger to put into his belt.&nbsp; He placed the remainder of
the provisions in his wallet, threw a thick purple cloth mantle
over the Duke, and then desired him to lie down on the straw
which he had brought in.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall hide you in
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and carry you through the hall, as if
I was going to feed my horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they will never guess!&rdquo; cried Richard,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will be quite still&mdash;I will make no
noise&mdash;I will hold my breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mind you do not move hand or foot, or rustle the
straw.&nbsp; It is no play&mdash;it is life or death,&rdquo; said
Osmond, as he disposed the straw round the little boy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, can you breathe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Richard&rsquo;s voice from the
midst.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am I quite hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely.&nbsp; Now, remember, whatever happens, do not
move.&nbsp; May Heaven protect us!&nbsp; Now, the Saints be with
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard, from the interior of the bundle heard Osmond set open
the door; then he felt himself raised from the ground; Osmond was
carrying him along down the stairs, the ends of the straw
crushing and sweeping against the wall.&nbsp; The only way to the
outer door was through the hall, and here was the danger.&nbsp;
Richard heard voices, steps, loud singing and laughter, as if
feasting was going on; then some one said, &ldquo;Tending your
horse, Sieur de Centeville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Osmond made answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know,
since we lost our grooms, the poor black would come off badly,
did I not attend to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently came Carloman&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;O Osmond de
Centeville! is Richard better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is better, my Lord, I thank you, but hardly yet out
of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish he was well!&nbsp; And when will you let me
come to him, Osmond?&nbsp; Indeed, I would sit quiet, and not
disturb him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be yet, my Lord, though the Duke loves you
well&mdash;he told me so but now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&nbsp; Oh, tell him I love him very
much&mdash;better than any one here&mdash;and it is very dull
without him.&nbsp; Tell him so, Osmond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard could hardly help calling out to his dear little
Carloman; but he remembered the peril of Osmond&rsquo;s eyes and
the Queen&rsquo;s threat, and held his peace, with some vague
notion that some day he would make Carloman King of France.&nbsp;
In the meantime, half stifled with the straw, he felt himself
carried on, down the steps, across the court; and then he knew,
from the darkness and the changed sound of Osmond&rsquo;s tread,
that they were in the stable.&nbsp; Osmond laid him carefully
down, and whispered&mdash;&ldquo;All right so far.&nbsp; You can
breathe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not well.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you let me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;not for worlds.&nbsp; Now tell me if I
put you face downwards, for I cannot see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid the living heap of straw across the saddle, bound it
on, then led out the horse, gazing round cautiously as he did so;
but the whole of the people of the Castle were feasting, and
there was no one to watch the gates.&nbsp; Richard heard the
hollow sound of the hoofs, as the drawbridge was crossed, and
knew that he was free; but still Osmond held his arm over him,
and would not let him move, for some distance.&nbsp; Then, just
as Richard felt as if he could endure the stifling of the straw,
and his uncomfortable position, not a moment longer, Osmond
stopped the horse, took him down, laid him on the grass, and
released him.&nbsp; He gazed around; they were in a little wood;
evening twilight was just coming on, and the birds sang
sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free! free!&mdash;this is freedom!&rdquo; cried
Richard, leaping up in the delicious cool evening breeze;
&ldquo;the Queen and Lothaire, and that grim room, all far
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far yet,&rdquo; said Osmond; &ldquo;you must not
call yourself safe till the Epte is between us and them.&nbsp;
Into the saddle, my Lord; we must ride for our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p152b.jpg">
<img alt="Escape from captivity" src="images/p152s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Osmond helped the Duke to mount, and sprang to the saddle
behind him, set spurs to the horse, and rode on at a quick rate,
though not at full speed, as he wished to spare the horse.&nbsp;
The twilight faded, the stars came out, and still he rode, his
arm round the child, who, as night advanced, grew weary, and
often sunk into a sort of half doze, conscious all the time of
the trot of the horse.&nbsp; But each step was taking him further
from Queen Gerberge, and nearer to Normandy; and what recked he
of weariness?&nbsp; On&mdash;on; the stars grew pale again, and
the first pink light of dawn showed in the eastern sky; the sun
rose, mounted higher and higher, and the day grew hotter; the
horse went more slowly, stumbled, and though Osmond halted and
loosed the girth, he only mended his pace for a little while.</p>
<p>Osmond looked grievously perplexed; but they had not gone much
further before a party of merchants came in sight, winding their
way with a long train of loaded mules, and stout men to guard
them, across the plains, like an eastern caravan in the
desert.&nbsp; They gazed in surprise at the tall young Norman
holding the child upon the worn-out war-horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir merchant,&rdquo; said Osmond to the first,
&ldquo;see you this steed?&nbsp; Better horse never was ridden;
but he is sorely spent, and we must make speed.&nbsp; Let me
barter him with you for yonder stout palfrey.&nbsp; He is worth
twice as much, but I cannot stop to chaffer&mdash;ay or no at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant, seeing the value of Osmond&rsquo;s gallant
black, accepted the offer; and Osmond removing his saddle, and
placing Richard on his new steed, again mounted, and on they went
through the country which Osmond&rsquo;s eye had marked with the
sagacity men acquire by living in wild, unsettled places.&nbsp;
The great marshes were now far less dangerous than in the winter,
and they safely crossed them.&nbsp; There had, as yet, been no
pursuit, and Osmond&rsquo;s only fear was for his little charge,
who, not having recovered his full strength since his illness,
began to suffer greatly from fatigue in the heat of that broiling
summer day, and leant against Osmond patiently, but very wearily,
without moving or looking up.&nbsp; He scarcely revived when the
sun went down, and a cool breeze sprang up, which much refreshed
Osmond himself; and still more did it refresh the Squire to see,
at length, winding through the green pastures, a blue river, on
the opposite bank of which rose a high rocky mound, bearing a
castle with many a turret and battlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Epte! the Epte!&nbsp; There is Normandy, sir!&nbsp;
Look up, and see your own dukedom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Normandy!&rdquo; cried Richard, sitting upright.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, my own home!&rdquo;&nbsp; Still the Epte was wide and
deep, and the peril was not yet ended.&nbsp; Osmond looked
anxiously, and rejoiced to see marks of cattle, as if it had been
forded.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must try it,&rdquo; he said, and
dismounting, he waded in, leading the horse, and firmly holding
Richard in the saddle.&nbsp; Deep they went; the water rose to
Richard&rsquo;s feet, then to the horse&rsquo;s neck; then the
horse was swimming, and Osmond too, still keeping his firm hold;
then there was ground again, the force of the current was less,
and they were gaining the bank.&nbsp; At that instant, however,
they perceived two men aiming at them with cross-bows from the
castle, and another standing on the bank above them, who called
out, &ldquo;Hold!&nbsp; None pass the ford of Mont&eacute;mar
without permission of the noble Dame Yolande.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha! Bertrand, the Seneschal, is that you?&rdquo; returned
Osmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who calls me by my name?&rdquo; replied the
Seneschal.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I, Osmond de Centeville.&nbsp; Open
your gates quickly, Sir Seneschal; for here is the Duke, sorely
in need of rest and refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke!&rdquo; exclaimed Bertrand, hurrying down to
the landing-place, and throwing off his cap.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Duke! the Duke!&rdquo; rang out the shout from the men-at-arms on
the battlements above and in an instant more Osmond had led the
horse up from the water, and was exclaiming, &ldquo;Look up, my
Lord, look up!&nbsp; You are in your own dukedom again, and this
is Alberic&rsquo;s castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, indeed, most noble Lord Duke!&nbsp; Blessings
on the day!&rdquo; cried the Seneschal.&nbsp; &ldquo;What joy for
my Lady and my young Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sorely weary,&rdquo; said Osmond, looking
anxiously at Richard, who, even at the welcome cries that showed
so plainly that he was in his own Normandy, scarcely raised
himself or spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had been very sick ere I
brought him away.&nbsp; I doubt me they sought to poison him, and
I vowed not to tarry at Laon another hour after he was fit to
move.&nbsp; But cheer up, my Lord; you are safe and free now, and
here is the good Dame de Mont&eacute;mar to tend you, far better
than a rude Squire like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; said the Seneschal; &ldquo;our Dame is
gone with young Alberic on a pilgrimage to Jumi&egrave;ges to
pray for the Duke&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; What joy for them to know
that their prayers have been granted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond, however, could scarcely rejoice, so alarmed was he at
the extreme weariness and exhaustion of his charge, who, when
they brought him into the Castle hall, hardly spoke or looked,
and could not eat.&nbsp; They carried him up to Alberic&rsquo;s
bed, where he tossed about restlessly, too tired to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; said Osmond, &ldquo;I have been too
hasty.&nbsp; I have but saved him from the Franks to be his death
by my own imprudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; Sieur de Centeville,&rdquo; said the
Seneschal&rsquo;s wife, coming into the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
talk in that manner is the way to be his death, indeed.&nbsp;
Leave the child to me&mdash;he is only over-weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond was sure his Duke was among friends, and would have
been glad to trust him to a woman; but Richard had but one
instinct left in all his weakness and exhaustion&mdash;to cling
close to Osmond, as if he felt him his only friend and protector;
for he was, as yet, too much worn out to understand that he was
in Normandy and safe.&nbsp; For two or three hours, therefore,
Osmond and the Seneschal&rsquo;s wife watched on each side of his
bed, soothing his restlessness, until at length he became quiet,
and at last dropped sound asleep.</p>
<p>The sun was high in the heavens when Richard awoke.&nbsp; He
turned on his straw-filled crib, and looked up.&nbsp; It was not
the tapestried walls of his chamber at Laon that met his opening
eyes, but the rugged stone and tall loop-hole window of a turret
chamber.&nbsp; Osmond de Centeville lay on the floor by his side,
in the sound sleep of one overcome by long watching and
weariness.&nbsp; And what more did Richard see?</p>
<p>It was the bright face and sparkling eyes of Alberic de
Mont&eacute;mar, who was leaning against the foot of his bed,
gazing earnestly, as he watched for his waking.&nbsp; There was a
cry&mdash;&ldquo;Alberic! Alberic!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord!
my Lord!&rdquo; Richard sat up and held out both arms, and
Alberic flung himself into them.&nbsp; They hugged each other,
and uttered broken exclamations and screams of joy, enough to
have awakened any sleeper but one so wearied out as Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it true?&nbsp; Oh, am I really in Normandy
again?&rdquo; cried Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&mdash;oh, yes, my Lord!&nbsp; You are at
Mont&eacute;mar.&nbsp; Everything here is yours.&nbsp; The
bar-tailed hawk is quite well, and my mother will be here this
evening; she let me ride on the instant we heard the
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rode long and late, and I was very weary,&rdquo;
said Richard! &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care, now we are at
home.&nbsp; But I can hardly believe it!&nbsp; Oh, Alberic, it
has been very dreary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my Lord!&rdquo; said Alberic, standing by the
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here, and you will know you are at home
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard bounded to the window, and what a sight met his eyes!
The Castle court was thronged with men-at-arms and horses, the
morning sun sparkling on many a burnished hauberk and tall
conical helmet, and above them waved many a banner and pennon
that Richard knew full well.&nbsp; &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; he
shouted aloud with glee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, there is the horse-shoe
of Ferri&egrave;res! and there the chequers of Warenne!&nbsp; Oh,
and best of all, there is&mdash;there is our own red pennon of
Centeville!&nbsp; O Alberic!&nbsp; Alberic! is Sir Eric
here?&nbsp; I must go down to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bertrand sent out notice to them all, as soon as you
came, to come and guard our Castle,&rdquo; said Alberic,
&ldquo;lest the Franks should pursue you; but you are safe
now&mdash;safe as Norman spears can make you&mdash;thanks be to
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks to God!&rdquo; said Richard, crossing
himself and kneeling reverently for some minutes, while he
repeated his Latin prayer; then, rising and looking at Alberic,
he said, &ldquo;I must thank Him, indeed, for he has saved Osmond
and me from the cruel King and Queen, and I must try to be a less
hasty and overbearing boy than I was when I went away; for I
vowed that so I would be, if ever I came back.&nbsp; Poor Osmond,
how soundly he sleeps! Come, Alberic, show me the way to Sir
Eric!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, holding Alberic&rsquo;s hand, Richard left the room, and
descended the stairs to the Castle hall.&nbsp; Many of the Norman
knights and barons, in full armour, were gathered there; but
Richard looked only for one.&nbsp; He knew Sir Eric&rsquo;s
grizzled hair, and blue inlaid armour, though his back was
towards him, and in a moment, before his entrance had been
perceived, he sprang towards him, and, with outstretched arms,
exclaimed: &ldquo;Sir Eric&mdash;dear Sir Eric, here I am! Osmond
is safe!&nbsp; And is Fru Astrida well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Baron turned.&nbsp; &ldquo;My child!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, and clasped him in his mailed arms, while the tears
flowed down his rugged cheeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed be God that
you are safe, and that my son has done his duty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is Fru Astrida well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, right well, since she heard of your safety.&nbsp;
But look round, my Lord; it befits not a Duke to be clinging thus
round an old man&rsquo;s neck.&nbsp; See how many of your true
vassals be here, to guard you from the villain Franks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard stood up, and held out his hand, bowing courteously
and acknowledging the greetings of each bold baron, with a grace
and readiness he certainly had not when he left Normandy.&nbsp;
He was taller too; and though still pale, and not dressed with
much care (since he had hurried on his clothes with no help but
Alberic&rsquo;s)&mdash;though his hair was rough and disordered,
and the scar of the burn had not yet faded from his
check&mdash;yet still, with his bright blue eyes, glad face, and
upright form, he was a princely, promising boy, and the Norman
knights looked at him with pride and joy, more especially when,
unprompted, he said: &ldquo;I thank you, gallant knights, for
coming to guard me.&nbsp; I do not fear the whole French host now
I am among my own true Normans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Eric led him to the door of the hall to the top of the
steps, that the men-at-arms might see him; and then such a shout
rang out of &ldquo;Long live Duke
Richard!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Blessings on the little
Duke!&rdquo;&mdash;that it echoed and came back again from the
hills around&mdash;it pealed from the old tower&mdash;it roused
Osmond from his sleep&mdash;and, if anything more had been
wanting to do so, it made Richard feel that he was indeed in a
land where every heart glowed with loyal love for him.</p>
<p>Before the shout had died away, a bugle-horn was heard winding
before the gate; and Sir Eric, saying, &ldquo;It is the Count of
Harcourt&rsquo;s note,&rdquo; sent Bertrand to open the gates in
haste, while Alberic followed, as Lord of the Castle, to receive
the Count.</p>
<p>The old Count rode into the court, and to the foot of the
steps, where he dismounted, Alberic holding his stirrup.&nbsp; He
had not taken many steps upwards before Richard came voluntarily
to meet him (which he had never done before), held out his hand,
and said, &ldquo;Welcome, Count Bernard, welcome.&nbsp; Thank you
for coming to guard me.&nbsp; I am very glad to see you once
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my young Lord,&rdquo; said Bernard, &ldquo;I am
right glad to see you out of the clutches of the Franks! You know
friend from foe now, methinks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed I do, Count Bernard.&nbsp; I know you meant
kindly by me, and that I ought to have thanked you, and not been
angry, when you reproved me.&nbsp; Wait one moment, Sir Count;
there is one thing that I promised myself to say if ever I came
safe to my own dear home.&nbsp;
Walter&mdash;Maurice&mdash;Jeannot&mdash;all you of my household,
and of Sir Eric&rsquo;s&mdash;I know, before I went away, I was
often no good Lord to you; I was passionate, and proud, and
overbearing; but God has punished me for it, when I was far away
among my enemies, and sick and lonely.&nbsp; I am very sorry for
it, and I hope you will pardon me; for I will strive, and I hope
God will help me, never to be proud and passionate
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Sir Eric,&rdquo; said Bernard, &ldquo;you hear
what the boy says.&nbsp; If he speaks it out so bold and free,
without bidding, and if he holds to what he says, I doubt it not
that he shall not grieve for his journey to France, and that we
shall see him, in all things, such a Prince as his father of
blessed memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must thank Osmond for me,&rdquo; said Richard, as
Osmond came down, awakened at length.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is Osmond
who has helped me to bear my troubles; and as to saving me, why
he flew away with me even like an old eagle with its
eaglet.&nbsp; I say, Osmond, you must ever after this wear a pair
of wings on shield and pennon, to show how well we managed our
flight.&rdquo; <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will, my Lord,&rdquo; said Osmond, half asleep;
&ldquo;but &rsquo;twas a good long flight at a stretch, and I
trust never to have to fly before your foes or mine
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a glad summer&rsquo;s day was that! Even the three hours
spent in council did but renew the relish with which Richard
visited Alberic&rsquo;s treasures, told his adventures, and
showed the accomplishments he had learnt at Laon.&nbsp; The
evening was more joyous still; for the Castle gates were opened,
first to receive Dame Yolande Mont&eacute;mar, and not above a
quarter of an hour afterwards, the drawbridge was lowered to
admit the followers of Centeville; and in front of them appeared
Fru Astrida&rsquo;s own high cap.&nbsp; Richard made but one
bound into her arms, and was clasped to her breast; then held off
at arm&rsquo;s-length, that she might see how much he was grown,
and pity his scar; then hugged closer than ever: but, taking
another look, she declared that Osmond left his hair like King
Harald Horrid-locks; <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> and, drawing an
ivory comb from her pouch, began to pull out the thick tangles,
hurting him to a degree that would once have made him rebel, but
now he only fondled her the more.</p>
<p>As to Osmond, when he knelt before her, she blessed him, and
sobbed over him, and blamed him for over-tiring her darling, all
in one; and assuredly, when night closed in and Richard had, as
of old, told his beads beside her knee, the happiest boy in
Normandy was its little Duke.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Mont&eacute;mar was too near the frontier to be a safe abode
for the little Duke, and his uncle, Count Hubert of Senlis,
agreed with Bernard the Dane that he would be more secure beyond
the limits of his own duchy, which was likely soon to be the
scene of war; and, sorely against his will, he was sent in
secret, under a strong escort, first to the Castle of Coucy, and
afterwards to Senlis.</p>
<p>His consolation was, that he was not again separated from his
friends; Alberic, Sir Eric, and even Fru Astrida, accompanied
him, as well as his constant follower, Osmond.&nbsp; Indeed, the
Baron would hardly bear that he should be out of his sight; and
he was still so carefully watched, that it was almost like a
captivity.&nbsp; Never, even in the summer days, was he allowed
to go beyond the Castle walls; and his guardians would fain have
had it supposed that the Castle did not contain any such
guest.</p>
<p>Osmond did not give him so much of his company as usual, but
was always at work in the armourer&rsquo;s forge&mdash;a low,
vaulted chamber, opening into the Castle court.&nbsp; Richard and
Alberic were very curious to know what he did there; but he
fastened the door with an iron bar, and they were forced to
content themselves with listening to the strokes of the hammer,
keeping time to the voice that sang out, loud and cheerily, the
song of &ldquo;Sigurd&rsquo;s sword, and the maiden sleeping
within the ring of flame.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fru Astrida said Osmond
was quite right&mdash;no good weapon-smith ever toiled with open
doors; and when the boys asked him questions as to his work, he
only smiled, and said that they would see what it was when the
call to arms should come.</p>
<p>They thought it near at hand, for tidings came that Louis had
assembled his army, and marched into Normandy to recover the
person of the young Duke, and to seize the country.&nbsp; No
summons, however, arrived, but a message came instead, that Rouen
had been surrendered into the bands of the King.&nbsp; Richard
shed indignant tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
Castle!&nbsp; My own city in the hands of the foe!&nbsp; Bernard
is a traitor then!&nbsp; None shall hinder me from so calling
him.&nbsp; Why did we trust him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear, Lord Duke,&rdquo; said Osmond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you come to the years of Knighthood, your own sword
shall right you, in spite of all the false Danes, and falser
Franks, in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you too, son Osmond?&nbsp; I deemed you carried a
cooler brain than to miscall one who was true to Rollo&rsquo;s
race before you or yon varlet were born!&rdquo; said the old
Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has yielded my dukedom!&nbsp; It is mis-calling to
say he is aught but a traitor!&rdquo; cried Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Vile, treacherous, favour-seeking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, peace, my Lord,&rdquo; said the Baron.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bernard has more in that wary head of his than your young
wits, or my old ones, can unwind.&nbsp; What he is doing I may
not guess, but I gage my life his heart is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard was silent, remembering he had been once unjust, but
he grieved heartily when he thought of the French in
Rollo&rsquo;s tower, and it was further reported that the King
was about to share Normandy among his French vassals.&nbsp; A
fresh outcry broke out in the little garrison of Senlis, but Sir
Eric still persisted in his trust in his friend Bernard, even
when he heard that Centeville was marked out as the prey of the
fat French Count who had served for a hostage at Rouen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you now, my Lord?&rdquo; said he, after a
conference with a messenger at the gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Black
Raven has spread its wings.&nbsp; Fifty keels are in the Seine,
and Harald Blue-tooth&rsquo;s Long Serpent at the head of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King of Denmark! Come to my aid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that he is!&nbsp; Come at Bernard&rsquo;s secret
call, to right you, and put you on your father&rsquo;s
seat.&nbsp; Now call honest Harcourt a traitor, because he gave
not up your fair dukedom to the flame and sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No traitor to me,&rdquo; said Richard, pausing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, verily, but what more would you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, when I come to my dukedom, I will not be so
politic,&rdquo; said Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will be an open
friend or an open foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy grows too sharp for us,&rdquo; said Sir Eric,
smiling, &ldquo;but it was spoken like his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He grows more like his blessed father each day,&rdquo;
said Fru Astrida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Danes, father, the Danes!&rdquo; said
Osmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blows will be passing now.&nbsp; I may join
the host and win my spurs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; returned the Baron, &ldquo;so
my Lord here gives you leave: would that I could leave him and go
with you.&nbsp; It would do my very spirit good but to set foot
in a Northern keel once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would fain see what these men of the North
are,&rdquo; said Osmond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they are only Danes, not Norsemen, and there are no
Vikings, such as once were when Ragnar laid
waste&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, son, what talk is this for the child&rsquo;s
ears?&rdquo; broke in Fru Astrida, &ldquo;are these words for a
Christian Baron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pardon, mother,&rdquo; said the grey warrior, in
all humility, &ldquo;but my blood thrills to hear of a Northern
fleet at hand, and to think of Osmond drawing sword under a
Sea-King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, Osmond&rsquo;s steed was led to the door,
and such men-at-arms as could be spared from the garrison of
Senlis were drawn up in readiness to accompany him.&nbsp; The
boys stood on the steps, wishing they were old enough to be
warriors, and wondering what had become of him, until at length
the sound of an opening door startled them, and there, in the low
archway of the smithy, the red furnace glowing behind him, stood
Osmond, clad in bright steel, the links of his hauberk reflecting
the light, and on his helmet a pair of golden wings, while the
same device adorned his long pointed kite-shaped shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wings! our wings!&rdquo; cried Richard, &ldquo;the
bearing of Centeville!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May they fly after the foe, not before him,&rdquo; said
Sir Eric.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speed thee well, my son&mdash;let not our
Danish cousins say we learn Frank graces instead of Northern
blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such farewells, Osmond quitted Senlis, while the two boys
hastened to the battlements to watch him as long as he remained
in view.</p>
<p>The highest tower became their principal resort, and their
eyes were constantly on the heath where he had disappeared; but
days passed, and they grew weary of the watch, and betook
themselves to games in the Castle court.</p>
<p>One day, Alberic, in the character of a Dragon, was lying on
his back, panting hard so as to be supposed to cast out volumes
of flame and smoke at Richard, the Knight, who with a stick for a
lance, and a wooden sword, was waging fierce war; when suddenly
the Dragon paused, sat up, and pointed towards the warder on the
tower.&nbsp; His horn was at his lips, and in another moment, the
blast rang out through the Castle.</p>
<p>With a loud shout, both boys rushed headlong up the turret
stairs, and came to the top so breathless, that they could not
even ask the warder what he saw.&nbsp; He pointed, and the
keen-eyed Alberic exclaimed, &ldquo;I see!&nbsp; Look, my Lord, a
speck there on the heath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see! where, oh where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is behind the hillock now, but&mdash;oh, there
again!&nbsp; How fast he comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like the flight of a bird,&rdquo; said Richard,
&ldquo;fast, fast&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it be not flight in earnest,&rdquo; said
Alberic, a little anxiously, looking into the warder&rsquo;s
face, for he was a borderer, and tales of terror of the inroad of
the Vicomte du Contentin were rife on the marches of the
Epte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, young Sir,&rdquo; said the warder, &ldquo;no fear
of that.&nbsp; I know how men ride when they flee from the
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, there is no discomfiture in the pace of
that steed,&rdquo; said Sir Eric, who had by this time joined
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him clearer!&nbsp; I see the horse,&rdquo; cried
Richard, dancing with eagerness, so that Sir Eric caught hold of
him, exclaiming, &ldquo;You will be over the battlements! hold
still! better hear of a battle lost than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bears somewhat in his hand,&rdquo; said Alberic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A banner or pennon,&rdquo; said the warder;
&ldquo;methinks he rides like the young Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does!&nbsp; My brave boy!&nbsp; He has done good
service,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Eric, as the figure became more
developed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Danes have seen how we train our
young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wings bring good tidings,&rdquo; said
Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me go, Sir Eric, I must tell Fru
Astrida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drawbridge was lowered, the portcullis raised, and as all
the dwellers in the Castle stood gathered in the court, in rode
the warrior with the winged helm, bearing in his hand a drooping
banner; lowering it as he entered, it unfolded, and displayed,
trailing on the ground at the feet of the little Duke of
Normandy, the golden lilies of France.</p>
<p>A shout of amazement arose, and all gathered round him, asking
hurried questions.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great victory&mdash;the King a
prisoner&mdash;Montreuil slain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard would not be denied holding his hand, and leading him
to the hall, and there, sitting around him, they heard his
tidings.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s first question was, what he
thought of their kinsmen, the Danes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rude comrades, father, I must own,&rdquo; said Osmond,
smiling, and shaking his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not pledge
them in a skull-goblet&mdash;set in gold though it
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None the worse warriors,&rdquo; said Sir Eric.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay, ay, and you were dainty, and brooked not the hearty
old fashion of tearing the whole sheep to pieces.&nbsp; You must
needs cut your portion with the fine French knife at your
girdle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osmond could not see that a man was braver for being a savage,
but he held his peace; and Richard impatiently begged to hear how
the battle had gone, and where it had been fought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the bank of the Dive,&rdquo; said Osmond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, father, you might well call old Harcourt
wary&mdash;his name might better have been Fox-heart than
Bear-heart!&nbsp; He had sent to the Franks a message of
distress, that the Danes were on him in full force, and to pray
them to come to his aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust there was no treachery.&nbsp; No foul dealing
shall be wrought in my name,&rdquo; exclaimed Richard, with such
dignity of tone and manner, as made all feel he was indeed their
Duke, and forget his tender years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, or should I tell the tale with joy like
this?&rdquo; said Osmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bernard&rsquo;s view was
to bring the Kings together, and let Louis see you had friends to
maintain your right.&nbsp; He sought but to avoid
bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how chanced it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Danes were encamped on the Dive, and so soon as the
French came in sight, Blue-tooth sent a messenger to Louis, to
summon him to quit Neustria, and leave it to you, its lawful
owner.&nbsp; Thereupon, Louis, hoping to win him over with wily
words, invited him to hold a personal conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you, Osmond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where I had scarce patience to be.&nbsp; Bernard had
gathered all of us honest Normans together, and arranged us
beneath that standard of the King, as if to repel his Danish
inroad.&nbsp; Oh, he was, in all seeming, hand-and-glove with
Louis, guiding him by his counsel, and, verily, seeming his
friend and best adviser!&nbsp; But in one thing he could not
prevail.&nbsp; That ungrateful recreant, Herluin of Montreuil,
came with the King, hoping, it seems, to get his share of our
spoils; and when Bernard advised the King to send him home, since
no true Norman could bear the sight of him, the hot-headed Franks
vowed no Norman should hinder them from bringing whom they
chose.&nbsp; So a tent was set up by the riverside, wherein the
two Kings, with Bernard, Alan of Brittany, and Count Hugh, held
their meeting.&nbsp; We all stood without, and the two hosts
began to mingle together, we Normans making acquaintance with the
Danes.&nbsp; There was a red-haired, wild-looking fellow, who
told me he had been with Anlaff in England, and spoke much of the
doings of Hako in Norway; when, suddenly, he pointed to a Knight
who was near, speaking to a Cotentinois, and asked me his
name.&nbsp; My blood boiled as I answered, for it was Montreuil
himself!&nbsp; &lsquo;The cause of your Duke&rsquo;s
death!&rsquo; said the Dane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ha, ye Normans are
fallen sons of Odin, to see him yet live!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said, I trust, my son, that we follow not the laws
of Odin?&rdquo; said Fru Astrida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no space for a word, grandmother; the Danes took
the vengeance on themselves.&nbsp; In one moment they rushed on
Herluin with their axes, and the unhappy man was dead.&nbsp; All
was tumult; every one struck without knowing at whom, or for
what.&nbsp; Some shouted, &lsquo;<i>Thor Hulfe</i>!&rsquo; some
&lsquo;<i>Dieu aide</i>!&rsquo; others &lsquo;<i>Montjoie St.
Denis</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; Northern blood against French, that was
all our guide.&nbsp; I found myself at the foot of this standard,
and had a hard combat for it; but I bore it away at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Kings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hurried out of the tent, it seems, to rejoin their
men.&nbsp; Louis mounted, but you know of old, my Lord, he is but
an indifferent horseman, and the beast carried him into the midst
of the Danes, where King Harald caught his bridle, and delivered
him to four Knights to keep.&nbsp; Whether he dealt secretly with
them, or whether they, as they declared, lost sight of him whilst
plundering his tent, I cannot say; but when Harald demanded him
of them, he was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! is this what you call having the King
prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear.&nbsp; He rode four leagues, and met one
of the baser sort of Rouennais, whom he bribed to hide him in the
Isle of Willows.&nbsp; However, Bernard made close inquiries,
found the fellow had been seen in speech with a French horseman,
pounced on his wife and children, and threatened they should die
if he did not disclose the secret.&nbsp; So the King was forced
to come out of his hiding-place, and is now fast guarded in
Rollo&rsquo;s tower&mdash;a Dane, with a battle-axe on his
shoulder, keeping guard at every turn of the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; cried Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder how
he likes it.&nbsp; I wonder if he remembers holding me up to the
window, and vowing that he meant me only good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you believed him, my Lord,&rdquo; said Osmond,
slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a little boy then,&rdquo; said Richard,
proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the very walls must remind him of his
oath, and how Count Bernard said, as he dealt with me, so might
Heaven deal with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember it, my child&mdash;beware of broken
vows,&rdquo; said Father Lucas; &ldquo;but remember it not in
triumph over a fallen foe.&nbsp; It were better that all came at
once to the chapel, to bestow their thanksgivings where alone
they are due.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>After nearly a year&rsquo;s captivity, the King engaged to pay
a ransom, and, until the terms could be arranged, his two sons
were to be placed as hostages in the hands of the Normans, whilst
he returned to his own domains.&nbsp; The Princes were to be sent
to Bayeux; whither Richard had returned, under the charge of the
Centevilles, and was now allowed to ride and walk abroad freely,
provided he was accompanied by a guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall rejoice to have Carloman, and make him
happy,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;but I wish Lothaire were not
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said good Father Lucas, &ldquo;he comes
that you may have a first trial in your father&rsquo;s last
lesson, and Abbot Martin&rsquo;s, and return good for
evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke&rsquo;s cheek flushed, and he made no answer.</p>
<p>He and Alberic betook themselves to the watch-tower, and, by
and by, saw a cavalcade approaching, with a curtained vehicle in
the midst, slung between two horses.&nbsp; &ldquo;That cannot be
the Princes,&rdquo; said Alberic; &ldquo;that must surely be some
sick lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope it is not the Queen,&rdquo; exclaimed
Richard, in dismay.&nbsp; &ldquo;But no; Lothaire is such a
coward, no doubt he was afraid to ride, and she would not trust
her darling without shutting him up like a demoiselle.&nbsp; But
come down, Alberic; I will say nothing unkind of Lothaire, if I
can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard met the Princes in the court, his sunny hair
uncovered, and bowing with such becoming courtesy, that Fru
Astrida pressed her son&rsquo;s arm, and bade him say if their
little Duke was not the fairest and noblest child in
Christendom.</p>
<p>With black looks, Lothaire stepped from the litter, took no
heed of the little Duke, but, roughly calling his attendant,
Charlot, to follow him, he marched into the hall, vouchsafing
neither word nor look to any as he passed, threw himself into the
highest seat, and ordered Charlot to bring him some wine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard, looking into the litter, saw Carloman
crouching in a corner, sobbing with fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carloman!&mdash;dear Carloman!&mdash;do not cry.&nbsp;
Come out!&nbsp; It is I&mdash;your own Richard!&nbsp; Will you
not let me welcome you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carloman looked, caught at the outstretched hand, and clung to
his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Richard, send us back!&nbsp; Do not let the savage
Danes kill us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will hurt you.&nbsp; There are no Danes
here.&nbsp; You are my guest, my friend, my brother.&nbsp; Look
up! here is my own Fru Astrida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my mother said the Northmen would kill us for
keeping you captive.&nbsp; She wept and raved, and the cruel men
dragged us away by force.&nbsp; Oh, let us go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot do that,&rdquo; said Richard; &ldquo;for you
are the King of Denmark&rsquo;s captives, not mine; but I will
love you, and you shall have all that is mine, if you will only
not cry, dear Carloman.&nbsp; Oh, Fru Astrida, what shall I
do?&nbsp; You comfort him&mdash;&rdquo; as the poor boy clung
sobbing to him.</p>
<p>Fru Astrida advanced to take his hand, speaking in a soothing
voice, but he shrank and started with a fresh cry of
terror&mdash;her tall figure, high cap, and wrinkled face, were
to him witch-like, and as she knew no French, he understood not
her kind words.&nbsp; However, he let Richard lead him into the
hall, where Lothaire sat moodily in the chair, with one leg
tucked under him, and his finger in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Sir Duke,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is there
nothing to be had in this old den of yours?&nbsp; Not a drop of
Bordeaux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard tried to repress his anger at this very uncivil way of
speaking, and answered, that he thought there was none, but there
was plenty of Norman cider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I would taste your mean peasant drinks! I bade
them bring my supper&mdash;why does it not come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are not master here,&rdquo; trembled on
Richard&rsquo;s lips, but he forced it back, and answered that it
would soon be ready, and Carloman looked imploringly at his
brother, and said, &ldquo;Do not make them angry,
Lothaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, crying still, foolish child?&rdquo; said
Lothaire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not know that if they dare to cross
us, my father will treat them as they deserve?&nbsp; Bring
supper, I say, and let me have a pasty of ortolans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are none&mdash;they are not in season,&rdquo;
said Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to give me nothing I like?&nbsp; I tell you
it shall be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a pullet roasting,&rdquo; began Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, I do not care for pullets&mdash;I will have
ortolans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do not take order with that boy, my name is not
Eric,&rdquo; muttered the Baron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must he not have made our poor child
suffer!&rdquo; returned Fru Astrida, &ldquo;but the little one
moves my heart.&nbsp; How small and weakly he is, but it is worth
anything to see our little Duke so tender to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is too brave not to be gentle,&rdquo; said Osmond;
and, indeed, the high-spirited, impetuous boy was as soft and
kind as a maiden, with that feeble, timid child.&nbsp; He coaxed
him to eat, consoled him, and, instead of laughing at his fears,
kept between him and the great bloodhound Hardigras, and drove it
off when it came too near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that dog away,&rdquo; said Lothaire,
imperiously.&nbsp; No one moved to obey him, and the dog, in
seeking for scraps, again came towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; he repeated, and struck it with
his foot.&nbsp; The dog growled, and Richard started up in
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Lothaire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I care not what
else you do, but my dogs and my people you shall not
maltreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I am Prince!&nbsp; I do what I will!&nbsp;
Ha! who laughs there?&rdquo; cried the passionate boy, stamping
on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so easy for French Princes to scourge
free-born Normans here,&rdquo; said the rough voice of Walter the
huntsman: &ldquo;there is a reckoning for the stripe my Lord Duke
bore for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, Walter,&rdquo; began Richard; but Lothaire
had caught up a footstool, and was aiming it at the huntsman,
when his arm was caught.</p>
<p>Osmond, who knew him well enough to be prepared for such
outbreaks, held him fast by both hands, in spite of his
passionate screams and struggles, which were like those of one
frantic.</p>
<p>Sir Eric, meanwhile, thundered forth in his Norman patois,
&ldquo;I would have you to know, young Sir, Prince though you be,
you are our prisoner, and shall taste of a dungeon, and bread and
water, unless you behave yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either Lothaire did not hear, or did not believe, and fought
more furiously in Osmond&rsquo;s arms, but he had little chance
with the stalwart young warrior, and, in spite of Richard&rsquo;s
remonstrances, he was carried from the hall, roaring and kicking,
and locked up alone in an empty room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone for the present,&rdquo; said Sir Eric,
putting the Duke aside, &ldquo;when he knows his master, we shall
have peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Richard had to turn, to reassure Carloman, who had taken
refuge in a dark corner, and there shook like an aspen leaf,
crying bitterly, and starting with fright, when Richard touched
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not put me in the dungeon.&nbsp; I cannot bear
the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard again tried to comfort him, but he did not seem to
hear or heed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! they said you would beat and hurt
us for what we did to you! but, indeed, it was not I that burnt
your cheek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would not hurt you for worlds, dear Carloman;
Lothaire is not in the dungeon&mdash;he is only shut up till he
is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Lothaire that did it,&rdquo; repeated Carloman,
&ldquo;and, indeed, you must not be angry with me, for my mother
was so cross with me for not having stopped Osmond when I met him
with the bundle of straw, that she gave me a blow, that knocked
me down.&nbsp; And were you really there, Richard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard told his story, and was glad to find Carloman could
smile at it; and then Fru Astrida advised him to take his little
friend to bed.&nbsp; Carloman would not lie down without still
holding Richard&rsquo;s hand, and the little Duke spared no pains
to set him at rest, knowing what it was to be a desolate captive
far from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would be good to me,&rdquo; said
Carloman.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to Lothaire, it serves him right, that
you should use him as he used you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Carloman; if I had a brother I would never
speak so of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Lothaire is so unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but we must be kind to those who are unkind to
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child rose on his elbow, and looked into Richard&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one ever told me so before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carloman, not Brother Hilary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heed Brother Hilary&mdash;he is so lengthy, and
wearisome; besides, no one is ever kind to those that hate
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was,&rdquo; said Richard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they killed him!&rdquo; said Carloman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Richard, crossing himself, &ldquo;but
he is gone to be in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it is happier there, than here,&rdquo; said
Carloman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not happy.&nbsp; But tell me why
should we be good to those that hate us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the holy Saints were&mdash;and look at the
Crucifix, Carloman.&nbsp; That was for them that hated Him.&nbsp;
And, don&rsquo;t you know what our Pater Noster says?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor little Carloman could only repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer
in Latin&mdash;he had not the least notion of its
meaning&mdash;in which Richard had been carefully instructed by
Father Lucas.&nbsp; He began to explain it, but before many words
had passed his lips, little Carloman was asleep.</p>
<p>The Duke crept softly away to beg to be allowed to go to
Lothaire; he entered the room, already dark, with a pine torch in
his hand, that so flickered in the wind, that he could at first
see nothing, but presently beheld a dark lump on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Lothaire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lothaire cut him short.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get away,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it is your turn now, it will be mine by and
by.&nbsp; I wish my mother had kept her word, and put your eyes
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s temper did not serve for such a reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is a foul shame of you to speak so, when I only came
out of kindness to you&mdash;so I shall leave you here all night,
and not ask Sir Eric to let you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he swung back the heavy door with a resounding
clang.&nbsp; But his heart smote him when he told his beads, and
remembered what he had said to Carloman.&nbsp; He knew he could
not sleep in his warm bed when Lothaire was in that cold gusty
room.&nbsp; To be sure, Sir Eric said it would do him good, but
Sir Eric little knew how tender the French Princes were.</p>
<p>So Richard crept down in the dark, slid back the bolt, and
called, &ldquo;Prince, Prince, I am sorry I was angry.&nbsp; Come
out, and let us try to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Lothaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of the cold and dark.&nbsp; Here am I.&nbsp; I
will show you the way.&nbsp; Where is your hand?&nbsp; Oh, how
cold it is.&nbsp; Let me lead you down to the hall
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lothaire was subdued by fright, cold, and darkness, and
quietly allowed Richard to lead him down.&nbsp; Round the fire,
at the lower end of the hall, snored half-a-dozen men-at-arms; at
the upper hearth there was only Hardigras, who raised his head as
the boys came in.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s whisper and soft pat
quieted him instantly, and the two little Princes sat on the
hearth together, Lothaire surprised, but sullen.&nbsp; Richard
stirred the embers, so as to bring out more heat, then spoke:
&ldquo;Prince, will you let us be friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must, if I am in your power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would be my guest and comrade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will; I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard thought his advances might have been more graciously
met, and, having little encouragement to say more, took Lothaire
to bed, as soon as he was warm.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>As the Baron had said, there was more peace now that Lothaire
had learnt to know that he must submit, and that no one cared for
his threats of his father&rsquo;s or his mother&rsquo;s
vengeance.&nbsp; He was very sulky and disagreeable, and severely
tried Richard&rsquo;s forbearance; but there were no fresh
outbursts, and, on the whole, from one week to another, there
might be said to be an improvement.&nbsp; He could not always
hold aloof from one so good-natured and good-humoured as the
little Duke; and the fact of being kept in order could not but
have some beneficial effect on him, after such spoiling as his
had been at home.</p>
<p>Indeed, Osmond was once heard to say, it was a pity the boy
was not to be a hostage for life; to which Sir Eric replied,
&ldquo;So long as we have not the training of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Carloman, meanwhile, recovered from his fears of all
the inmates of the Castle excepting Hardigras, at whose approach
he always shrank and trembled.</p>
<p>He renewed his friendship with Osmond, no longer started at
the entrance of Sir Eric, laughed at Alberic&rsquo;s merry ways,
and liked to sit on Fru Astrida&rsquo;s lap, and hear her sing,
though he understood not one word; but his especial love was
still for his first friend, Duke Richard.&nbsp; Hand-in-hand they
went about together, Richard sometimes lifting him up the steep
steps, and, out of consideration for him, refraining from rough
play; and Richard led him to join with him in those lessons that
Father Lucas gave the children of the Castle, every Friday and
Sunday evening in the Chapel.&nbsp; The good Priest stood on the
Altar steps, with the children in a half circle round
him&mdash;the son and daughter of the armourer, the
huntsman&rsquo;s little son, the young Baron de Mont&eacute;mar,
the Duke of Normandy, and the Prince of France, all were equal
there&mdash;and together they learnt, as he explained to them the
things most needful to believe; and thus Carloman left off
wondering why Richard thought it right to be good to his enemies;
and though at first he had known less than even the little
leather-coated huntsman, he seemed to take the holy lessons in
faster than any of them&mdash;yes, and act on them, too.&nbsp;
His feeble health seemed to make him enter into their comfort and
meaning more than even Richard; and Alberic and Father Lucas soon
told Fru Astrida that it was a saintly-minded child.</p>
<p>Indeed, Carloman was more disposed to thoughtfulness, because
he was incapable of joining in the sports of the other
boys.&nbsp; A race round the court was beyond his strength, the
fresh wind on the battlements made him shiver and cower, and loud
shouting play was dreadful to him.&nbsp; In old times, he used to
cry when Lothaire told him he must have his hair cut, and be a
priest; now, he only said quietly, he should like it very much,
if he could be good enough.</p>
<p>Fru Astrida sighed and shook her head, and feared the poor
child would never grow up to be anything on this earth.&nbsp;
Great as had been the difference at first between him and
Richard, it was now far greater.&nbsp; Richard was an unusually
strong boy for ten years old, upright and broad-chested, and
growing very fast; while Carloman seemed to dwindle, stooped
forward from weakness, had thin pinched features, and sallow
cheeks, looking like a plant kept in the dark.</p>
<p>The old Baron said that hardy, healthy habits would restore
the puny children; and Lothaire improved in health, and therewith
in temper; but his little brother had not strength enough to bear
the seasoning.&nbsp; He pined and drooped more each day; and as
the autumn came on, and the wind was chilly, he grew worse, and
was scarcely ever off the lap of the kind Lady Astrida.&nbsp; It
was not a settled sickness, but he grew weaker, and wasted
away.&nbsp; They made up a little couch for him by the fire, with
the high settle between it and the door, to keep off the
draughts; and there he used patiently to lie, hour after hour,
speaking feebly, or smiling and seeming pleased, when any one of
those he loved approached.&nbsp; He liked Father Lucas to come
and say prayers with him; and he never failed to have a glad
look, when his dear little Duke came to talk to him, in his
cheerful voice, about his rides and his hunting and hawking
adventures.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s sick guest took up much of his
thoughts, and he never willingly spent many hours at a distance
from him, softening his step and lowering his voice, as he
entered the hall, lest Carloman should be asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard, is it you?&rdquo; said the little boy, as the
young figure came round the settle in the darkening twilight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; How do you feel now, Carloman; are you
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No better, thanks, dear Richard;&rdquo; and the little
wasted fingers were put into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the pain come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I have been lying still, musing; Richard, I shall
never be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not say so!&nbsp; You will, indeed you will,
when spring comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I should die,&rdquo; said the little boy;
&ldquo;I think I shall.&nbsp; But do not grieve, Richard.&nbsp; I
do not feel much afraid.&nbsp; You said it was happier there than
here, and I know it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where my blessed father is,&rdquo; said Richard,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;But oh, Carloman, you are so young to
die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want to live.&nbsp; This is a fighting, hard
world, full of cruel people; and it is peace there.&nbsp; You are
strong and brave, and will make them better; but I am weak and
fearful&mdash;I could only sigh and grieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Carloman!&nbsp; Carloman!&nbsp; I cannot spare
you.&nbsp; I love you like my own brother.&nbsp; You must not
die&mdash;you must live to see your father and mother
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commend me to them,&rdquo; said Carloman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am going to my Father in heaven.&nbsp; I am glad I am
here, Richard; I never was so happy before.&nbsp; I should have
been afraid indeed to die, if Father Lucas had not taught me how
my sins are pardoned.&nbsp; Now, I think the Saints and Angels
are waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke feebly, and his last words faltered into sleep.&nbsp;
He slept on; and when supper was brought, and the lamps were
lighted, Fru Astrida thought the little face looked unusually
pale and waxen; but he did not awake.&nbsp; At night, they
carried him to his bed, and he was roused into a half conscious
state, moaning at being disturbed.&nbsp; Fru Astrida would not
leave him, and Father Lucas shared her watch.</p>
<p>At midnight, all were wakened by the slow notes, falling one
by one on the ear, of the solemn passing-bell, calling them to
waken, that their prayers might speed a soul on its way.&nbsp;
Richard and Lothaire were soon at the bedside.&nbsp; Carloman lay
still asleep, his hands folded on his breast, but his breath came
in long gasps.&nbsp; Father Lucas was praying over him, and
candles were placed on each side of the bed.&nbsp; All was still,
the boys not daring to speak or move.&nbsp; There came a longer
breath&mdash;then they heard no more.&nbsp; He was, indeed, gone
to a happier home&mdash;a truer royalty than ever had been his on
earth.</p>
<p>Then the boys&rsquo; grief burst out.&nbsp; Lothaire screamed
for his mother, and sobbed out that he should die too&mdash;he
must go home.&nbsp; Richard stood by the bed, large silent tears
rolling down his cheeks, and his chest heaving with suppressed
sobs.</p>
<p>Fru Astrida led them from the room, back to their beds.&nbsp;
Lothaire soon cried himself to sleep.&nbsp; Richard lay awake,
sorrowful, and in deep thought; while that scene in St.
Mary&rsquo;s, at Rouen, returned before his eyes, and though it
had passed nearly two years ago, its meaning and its teaching had
sunk deep into his mind, and now stood before him more
completely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I go, when I come to die, if I have not
returned good for evil?&rdquo;&nbsp; And a resolution was taken
in the mind of the little Duke.</p>
<p>Morning came, and brought back the sense that his gentle
little companion was gone from him; and Richard wept again, as if
he could not be consoled, as he beheld the screened couch where
the patient smile would never again greet him.&nbsp; He now knew
that he had loved Carloman all the more for his weakness and
helplessness; but his grief was not like Lothaire&rsquo;s, for
with the Prince&rsquo;s was still joined a selfish fear: his cry
was still, that he should die too, if not set free, and violent
weeping really made him heavy and ill.</p>
<p>The little corpse, embalmed and lapped in lead, was to be sent
back to France, that it might rest with its forefathers in the
city of Rheims; and Lothaire seemed to feel this as an additional
stroke of desertion.&nbsp; He was almost beside himself with
despair, imploring every one, in turn, to send him home, though
he well knew they were unable to do so.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Eric,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;you told me there
was a Parlement to be held at Falaise, between Count Bernard and
the King of Denmark.&nbsp; I mean to attend it.&nbsp; Will you
come with me, or shall Osmond go, and you remain in charge of the
Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How now, Lord Richard, you were not wont to love a
Parlement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to say,&rdquo; replied Richard.&nbsp;
The Baron made no objection, only telling his mother that the
Duke was a marvellous wise child, and that he would soon be fit
to take the government himself.</p>
<p>Lothaire lamented the more when he found that Richard was
going away; his presence seemed to him a protection, and he
fancied, now Carloman was dead, that his former injuries were
about to be revenged.&nbsp; The Duke assured him, repeatedly,
that he meant him nothing but kindness, adding, &ldquo;When I
return, you will see, Lothaire;&rdquo; then, commending him to
the care and kindness of Fru Astrida, Osmond, and Alberic,
Richard set forth upon his pony, attended by Sir Eric and three
men-at-arms.</p>
<p>Richard felt sad when he looked back at Bayeux, and thought
that it no longer contained his dear little friend; but it was a
fresh bright frosty morning, the fields were covered with a
silvery-white coating, the flakes of hoar-frost sparkled on every
bush, and the hard ground rung cheerily to the tread of the
horses&rsquo; feet.&nbsp; As the yellow sun fought his way
through the grey mists that dimmed his brightness, and shone out
merrily in the blue heights of the sky, Richard&rsquo;s spirits
rose, and he laughed and shouted, as hare or rabbit rushed across
the heath, or as the plover rose screaming above his head,
flapping her broad wings across the wintry sky.</p>
<p>One night they slept at a Convent, where they heard that Hugh
of Paris had passed on to join the conference at Falaise.&nbsp;
The next day they rode on, and, towards the afternoon, the Baron
pointed to a sharp rocky range of hills, crowned by a tall solid
tower, and told Richard, yonder was his keep of Falaise, the
strongest Castle in Normandy.</p>
<p>The country was far more broken as they advanced&mdash;narrow
valleys and sharp hills, each little vale full of wood, and
interspersed with rocks.&nbsp; &ldquo;A choice place for
game,&rdquo; Sir Eric said and Richard, as he saw a herd of deer
dash down a forest glade, exclaimed, &ldquo;that they must come
here to stay, for some autumn sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be huntsmen abroad in the woods; for through
the frosty air came the baying of dogs, the shouts and calls of
men, and, now and then, the echoing, ringing notes of a
bugle.&nbsp; Richard&rsquo;s eyes and cheeks glowed with
excitement, and he pushed his brisk little pony on faster and
faster, unheeding that the heavier men and horses of his suite
were not keeping pace with him on the rough ground and through
the tangled boughs.</p>
<p>Presently, a strange sound of growling and snarling was heard
close at hand: his pony swerved aside, and could not be made to
advance; so Richard, dismounting, dashed through some briars, and
there, on an open space, beneath a precipice of dark ivy-covered
rock, that rose like a wall, he beheld a huge grey wolf and a
large dog in mortal combat.&nbsp; It was as if they had fallen or
rolled down the precipice together, not heeding it in their
fury.&nbsp; Both were bleeding, and the eyes of both glared like
red fiery glass in the dark shadow of the rock.&nbsp; The dog lay
undermost, almost overpowered, making but a feeble resistance;
and the wolf would, in another moment, be at liberty to spring on
the lonely child.</p>
<p>But not a thought of fear passed through his breast; to save
the dog was Richard&rsquo;s only idea.&nbsp; In one moment he had
drawn the dagger he wore at his girdle, ran to the two struggling
animals, and with all his force, plunged it into the throat of
the wolf, which, happily, was still held by the teeth of the
hound.</p>
<p>The struggles relaxed, the wolf rolled heavily aside, dead;
the dog lay panting and bleeding, and Richard feared he was
cruelly torn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor fellow! noble dog! what shall I
do to help you?&rdquo; and he gently smoothed the dark brindled
head.</p>
<p>A voice was now heard shouting aloud, at which the dog raised
and crested his head, as a figure in a hunting dress was coming
down a rocky pathway, an extremely tall, well-made man, of noble
features.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! holla!&nbsp; Vige!&nbsp; Vige!&nbsp;
How now, my brave hound?&rdquo; he said in the Northern tongue,
though not quite with the accent Richard was accustomed to hear
&ldquo;Art hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much torn, I fear,&rdquo; Richard called out, as the
faithful creature wagged his tail, and strove to rise and meet
his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, lad! what art thou?&rdquo; exclaimed the hunter,
amazed at seeing the boy between the dead wolf and wounded
dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look like one of those Frenchified Norman
gentilesse, with your smooth locks and gilded baldrick, yet your
words are Norse.&nbsp; By the hammer of Thor! that is a dagger in
the wolf&rsquo;s throat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is mine,&rdquo; said Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I found
your dog nearly spent, and I made in to the rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&nbsp; Well done!&nbsp; I would not have lost
Vige for all the plunder of Italy.&nbsp; I am beholden to you, my
brave young lad,&rdquo; said the stranger, all the time examining
and caressing the hound.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your name?&nbsp;
You cannot be Southern bred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, more shouts came near; and the Baron de
Centeville rushed through the trees holding Richard&rsquo;s pony
by the bridle.&nbsp; &ldquo;My Lord, my Lord!&mdash;oh, thank
Heaven, I see you safe!&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same moment a party
of hunters also approached by the path, and at the head of them
Bernard the Dane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed he, &ldquo;what do I see?&nbsp; My
young Lord! what brought you here?&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a hasty
obeisance, Bernard took Richard&rsquo;s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came hither to attend your council,&rdquo; replied
Richard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a boon to ask of the King of
Denmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any boon the King of Denmark has in his power will be
yours,&rdquo; said the dog&rsquo;s master, slapping his hand on
the little Duke&rsquo;s shoulder, with a rude, hearty
familiarity, that took him by surprise; and he looked up with a
shade of offence, till, on a sudden flash of perception, he took
off his cap, exclaiming, &ldquo;King Harald himself!&nbsp; Pardon
me, Sir King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon, Jarl Richart!&nbsp; What would you have me
pardon?&mdash;your saving the life of Vige here?&nbsp; No French
politeness for me.&nbsp; Tell me your boon, and it is
yours.&nbsp; Shall I take you a voyage, and harry the fat monks
of Ireland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard recoiled a little from his new friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ha!&nbsp; I forgot.&nbsp; They have made a
Christian of you&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity.&nbsp; You have the
Northern spirit so strong.&nbsp; I had forgotten it.&nbsp; Come,
walk by my side, and let me hear what you would ask.&nbsp; Holla,
you Sweyn! carry Vige up to the Castle, and look to his
wounds.&nbsp; Now for it, young Jarl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boon is, that you would set free Prince
Lothaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&mdash;the young Frank?&nbsp; Why they kept you
captive, burnt your face, and would have made an end of you but
for your clever Bonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is long past, and Lothaire is so wretched.&nbsp;
His brother is dead, and he is sick with grief, and he says he
shall die, if he does not go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thing too for the treacherous race to die out in
him!&nbsp; What should you care for him? he is your
foe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a Christian,&rdquo; was Richard&rsquo;s
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I promised you whatever you might ask.&nbsp; All
my share of his ransom, or his person, bond or free, is
yours.&nbsp; You have only to prevail with your own Jarls and
Bonders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richard feared this would be more difficult; but Abbot Martin
came to the meeting, and took his part.&nbsp; Moreover, the idea
of their hostage dying in their hands, so as to leave them
without hold upon the King, had much weight with them; and, after
long deliberation, they consented that Lothaire should be
restored to his father, without ransom but only on condition that
Louis should guarantee to the Duke the peaceable possession of
the country, as far as St. Clair sur Epte, which had been long in
dispute; so that Alberic became, indisputably, a vassal of
Normandy.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the happiest day in Richard&rsquo;s life when
he rode back to Bayeux, to desire Lothaire to prepare to come
with him to St. Clair, there to be given back into the hands of
his father.</p>
<p>And then they met King Louis, grave and sorrowful for the loss
of his little Carloman, and, for the time, repenting of his
misdeeds towards the orphan heir of Normandy.</p>
<p>He pressed the Duke in his arms, and his kiss was a genuine
one as he said, &ldquo;Duke Richard, we have not deserved this of
you.&nbsp; I did not treat you as you have treated my
children.&nbsp; We will be true lord and vassal from
henceforth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lothaire&rsquo;s last words were, &ldquo;Farewell,
Richard.&nbsp; If I lived with you, I might be good like
you.&nbsp; I will never forget what you have done for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Richard once more entered Rouen in state, his subjects
shouting round him in transports of joy, better than all his
honour and glory was the being able to enter the Church of our
Lady, and kneel by his father&rsquo;s grave, with a clear
conscience, and the sense that he had tried to keep that last
injunction.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Years had passed away.&nbsp; The oaths of Louis, and promises
of Lothaire, had been broken; and Arnulf of Flanders, the
murderer of Duke William, had incited them to repeated and
treacherous inroads on Normandy; so that Richard&rsquo;s life,
from fourteen to five or six-and-twenty, had been one long war in
defence of his country.&nbsp; But it had been a glorious war for
him, and his gallant deeds had well earned for him the title of
&ldquo;Richard the Fearless&rdquo;&mdash;a name well deserved;
for there was but one thing he feared, and that was, to do
wrong.</p>
<p>By and by, success and peace came; and then Arnulf of
Flanders, finding open force would not destroy him, three times
made attempts to assassinate him, like his father, by
treachery.&nbsp; But all these had failed; and now Richard had
enjoyed many years of peace and honour, whilst his enemies had
vanished from his sight.</p>
<p>King Louis was killed by a fall from his horse; Lothaire died
in early youth, and in him ended the degenerate line of
Charlemagne; Hugh Capet, the son of Richard&rsquo;s old friend,
Hugh the White, was on the throne of France, his sure ally and
brother-in-law, looking to him for advice and aid in all his
undertakings.</p>
<p>Fru Astrida and Sir Eric had long been in their quiet graves;
Osmond and Alberic were among Richard&rsquo;s most trusty
councillors and warriors; Abbot Martin, in extreme old age, still
ruled the Abbey of Jumi&egrave;ges, where Richard, like his
father, loved to visit him, hold converse with him, and refresh
himself in the peaceful cloister, after the affairs of state and
war.</p>
<p>And Richard himself was a grey-headed man, of lofty stature
and majestic bearing.&nbsp; His eldest son was older than he had
been himself when he became the little Duke, and he had even
begun to remember his father&rsquo;s project, of an old age to be
spent in retirement and peace.</p>
<p>It was on a summer eve, that Duke Richard sat beside the
white-bearded old Abbot, within the porch, looking at the sun
shining with soft declining beams on the arches and
columns.&nbsp; They spoke together of that burial at Rouen, and
of the silver key; the Abbot delighting to tell, over and over
again, all the good deeds and good sayings of William
Longsword.</p>
<p>As they sat, a man, also very old and shrivelled and bent,
came up to the cloister gate, with the tottering, feeble step of
one pursued beyond his strength, coming to take sanctuary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be the crime of one so aged and feeble?&rdquo;
said the Duke, in surprise.</p>
<p>At the sight of him, a look of terror shot from the old
man&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; He clasped his hands together, and turned
as if to flee; then, finding himself incapable of escape, he
threw himself on the ground before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, mercy! noble, most noble Duke!&rdquo; was all he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up&mdash;kneel not to me.&nbsp; I cannot brook
this from one who might be my father,&rdquo; said Richard, trying
to raise him; but at those words the old man groaned and crouched
lower still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; said the Duke.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
this holy place thou art secure, be thy deed what it may.&nbsp;
Speak!&mdash;who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou not know me?&rdquo; said the suppliant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Promise mercy, ere thou dost hear my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen that face under a helmet,&rdquo; said the
Duke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art Arnulf of Flanders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a deep silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wherefore art thou here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I delayed to own the French King Hugh.&nbsp; He has
taken my towns and ravaged my lands.&nbsp; Each Frenchman and
each Norman vows to slay me, in revenge for your wrongs, Lord
Duke.&nbsp; I have been driven hither and thither, in fear of my
life, till I thought of the renown of Duke Richard, not merely
the most fearless, but the most merciful of Princes.&nbsp; I
sought to come hither, trusting that, when the holy Father Abbot
beheld my bitter repentance, he would intercede for me with you,
most noble Prince, for my safety and forgiveness.&nbsp; Oh,
gallant Duke, forgive and spare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up, Arnulf,&rdquo; said Richard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where the hand of the Lord hath stricken, it is not for
man to exact his own reckoning.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s death has
been long forgiven, and what you may have planned against myself
has, by the blessing of Heaven, been brought to nought.&nbsp;
From Normans at least you are safe; and it shall be my work to
ensure your pardon from my brother the King.&nbsp; Come into the
refectory: you need refreshment.&nbsp; The Lord Abbot makes you
welcome.&rdquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>Tears of gratitude and true repentance choked Arnulf&rsquo;s
speech, and he allowed himself to be raised from the ground, and
was forced to accept the support of the Duke&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>The venerable Abbot slowly rose, and held up his hand in an
attitude of blessing: &ldquo;The blessing of a merciful God be
upon the sinner who turneth from his evil way; and ten thousand
blessings of pardon and peace are already on the head of him who
hath stretched out his hand to forgive and aid him who was once
his most grievous foe!&rdquo;</p>

names in history shine with so consistent a lustre as that of
Richard; at first the little Duke, afterwards Richard aux longues

has only brought forward the perils of his childhood, but his
early manhood was likewise full of adventures, in which he always
proved himself brave, honourable, pious, and forbearing.&nbsp;
But for these our readers must search for themselves into early
French history, where all they will find concerning our hero will
only tend to exalt his character.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
